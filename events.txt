Title: Pre-Columbian Era
Description: Millennia before Cristopher Columbus' voyages to America, there existed a wide variety of tribes across the continent. Most of them arrived by crossing the Beringia land bridge from modern-day Siberia to Alaska searching for food. Their descendents would become known as American Indians (also known as Indians, Native Americans, and First Nations) sprung many distinct groups known as tribes, all with their own unique culture, religion, government, method of gathering food, lifestyle, etc. The tribes were most heavily influenced by their surrounding geography and environment: coastal tribes focused on fishing, those up north relied on catching beavers, Plains Indians hunted the local bison for food, etc. American Indians were typically nomadic, meaning that they migrated from one place to another in search of food and resources. However, once agriculture developed in Mesoamerica, some tribes began to remain in one spot and construct the first civilizations on the continents. Tribes often traded and warred with each other, much like tribes and nations elsewhere in the world and in the past. Life for the American Indians was permanently changed with the arrival of Christopher Columbus and other European explorers, who inadvertently introduced deadly diseases like smallpox to the New World. Indians had never been exposed to these viruses before and therefore had no immunity, leading to extreme vulnerability. Furthermore, Europeans had been able to build up resistances to a variety of pathogens in part because many of them lived near livestock, which are breeding grounds for illnesses. Domesticated animals were almost non-existent in the pre-Columbian Americas, so Indians had no such luck defending themselves from viruses. 90% of the continents' populations were wiped out within a century. Nevertheless, they continued to be a dominant force in the Americas for centuries. Today, they number about 70 million in total across North and South America, with about 5.2 million being in the modern-day United States.

Title: Asian-American land bridge disappears
Description: After thousands of years of gradual sea rise due to the melting of the glaciers, Beringia was swallowed up by the sea, preventing further migration between Asia and North America by land. This had the effect of isolating North and South America from Europe, Asia, and Africa for over 10,000 years, with the two regions growing and developing in isolation.

Title: Agriculture develops in Mesoamerica and Peru
Description: Mesoamericans domesticated the wild teosinte plant into corn. They learned that they could organize plant seeds into rows near their settlements instead of having to migrate across the continent to find wild varieties. This was the start of civilization in Mesoamerica, as if humans could stay in one place, they could build permanent settlements. Additionally, agriculture often produced a surplus of food, allowing people to focus on matters other than food. These settlements of a few families would grow over thousands of years to be small towns, and even cities like Tenochtitlan. Similar developments would occur in Peru, allowing the Inca tribe to flourish. The Aztecs traded their corn with nearby tribes, who learned the art of agriculture as well, though they were never able to build cities as large as Tenochtitlan. Soon, the practice had spread across the continents, though the closer to the Aztecs the tribe was, the more reliant on agriculture they tended to be. Meanwhile, tribes in areas such as the Arctic and Great Plains still relied on their old methods of nomadic hunting and gathering.

Title: Mound builders live in Mississippi Valley
Description: A group of Native Americans known simply as the "mound builders" survived and thrived in Mississippi Valley. They were known as such due to the large dirt mounds they constructed for their buildings. These mounds were organized into communities, such as Poverty Point in modern-day Louisiana. It was a political and economic center that established trade routes and mined minerals like copper and flint.

The inhabitants of the Mississippi River Valley during this period are known as "mound builders" because of the large mounds of earth they constructed thousands of years ago. The oldest known such mound is Watson Brake, constructed in modern-day northern Louisiana around 3500 BC, making it older than both the Egyptian Pyramids and Stonehenge. Watson Brake consists of eleven mounds ranging from 3 to 25 feet high connected by ridges, forming an oval 900 feet in diameter. Poverty Point, also in Louisiana, was built around 2000 years later, circa 1500 BC. It is a series of concentric semicircles overlooking the Mississippi River that takes up a square mile. These structures served as important political and commercial hubs for the mound builders, and were likely inspired by Mayan and Aztec pyramids like the Great Pyramid of Cholula. Archaeologists have found flint from Indiana and copper from Minnesota and Canada at this site, suggesting that the mound builders traded with tribes across the continent. The mound builders appeared to have disappeared around 1000, leaving the valley open for another culture to dominate the valley, Cahokia.

Title: Olmec culture flourishes
Description: The Olmecs were one of the earliest large Native American tribes, and lived in Mesoamerica around modern-day Veracruz, Tabasco, Oaxaca, and Chiapas. The region was similar to the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, and similarly was able to support cultures much larger than most others in the Americas. 

The Olmecs were densely populated, and were famous for producing a large amount of artwork using clay and jade, especially the "colossal heads" made from clay, ranging from 5 to 11 feet tall. They constructed a few large centers, such as San Lorenzo and La Venta in modern-day Tabasco. La Venta contains the Great Pyramid, the largest structure in Mesoamerica at the time, which today reaches 112 ft high after 2500 years of erosion. The Olmecs appear to have made various innovations, such as bloodletting, ball games, writing, the number zero, popcorn, a calendar, and possibly the compass and human sacrifice. 

Their rulers were typically important religious and spiritual figures. However, they lacked the developments made by later Mesoamerican societies like the Mayans, such as a standing army or caste system. Their population declined for unknown reasons, but their culture and innovations would be an important start for later cultures, like the Mayans nearly 2000 years later.

Title: Cahokia
Description: Cahokia was a city in the Mississippi River Valley, specifically in modern-day Illinois across the river from the modern city of St. Louis, MO. They first began developing the land around 700, but at its peak between 950 and 1250 they had a massive (for the time) city sporting 10,000-30,000 inhabitants, making it the largest settlement in the modern-day US for around 500-600 years. Like the earlier residents of the Mississippi River Valley, Cahokia contained many earthen mounds constructed by its inhabitants, the largest of which stood 100 feet tall. The settlement appeared to have dwindled by 1300.

Title: Hopi and Zuni
Description: The Hopi and Zuni were tribes that lived in modern-day New Mexico. They lived in settlements that were built into canyons and consisted of multiple-family homes, as well as more advanced structures like dams and canals. The largest known structure was Pueblo Bonita in Chaco Canyon, NM, was 5 stories tall and sported over 600 rooms, a size that was not matched in the US until around 1880. 

Like many other Native American civilizations, they frequently traded with other tribes, even those who lived far away, like Cahokia in the Mississippi River Valley and the Aztecs in Mesoamerica. After their peak circa 1200, they moved southeast, likely due to drought, and built villages and developed agriculture further. They lived like this up to when the Spanish encountered them around 1500. They were known as Pueblo Indians by the Spanish because they lived in settlements (pueblos in Spanish), unlike previous Native American tribes they had encountered before.

Title: Erik the Red lands in Greenland
Description: Viking explorer Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for manslaughter. He went searching for Greenland, which had been discovered by fellow Viking Gunnbjørn Ulfsson at the beginning of the century. In 982, he found it, and with Herjolf Bardsson he established the first European settlements in Greenland and in North America, including Herjolfsfjord, Brattahlíð, and Herjolfsnes. These settlements lasted for around 500 years.

Title: Bjarni Herjólfsson discovers Vinland
Description: After Erik the Red set up colonies in Greenland in 892, he remained their for three years until his exile expired. He subsequently returned to Iceland, he hoped to attract more settlers there, and even called it "Greenland" in order to make the land seem more appealing (though Greenland was actually anything but green). He convinced 25 sips to embark with him in 985. 

The journey was perilous, with only 14 making the complete trip. One of these ships contained Bjarni Herjólfsson, a merchant who was blown off course on his way to Greenland. After three days, he discovered land west of Greenland, an area that would later be known as Vinland (modern day Newfoundland). While he didn't explore it and soon rejoined the fleet, he later described the incident to Erik the Red's son, Lief Erikson, who would establish a settlement there in 1000. This event was the first time a European had ever sighted the mainland of the Americas.

Title: Leif Erikson lands in Vinland
Description: Around 985, Viking explorer Bjarni Herjólfsson sighted some land west of Greenland, an incident he later described to Leif Erikson, the son of Erik the Red, who had himself discovered Greenland. Leif Erikson, himself being an exlporer, took a crew of 35 and found land west of Greenland, which he named Vinland. They established the settlement of L'Anse aux Meadows on a large island (modern-day Newfoundland) and explored further, getting as far as modern-day New Brunswick (mainland North America) and even interacted with some of the American Indians living there. This marked the first time a European set foot on the North American mainland, though L'Anse aux Meadows was sparsely populated and interactions between the Vikings and American Indians were few. It would not be until Christopher Columbus' arrival nearly five centuries later that the Old and New Worlds would truly intermingle.

Title: Magna Carta
Description: The Magna Carta Libertatum was a charter of rights drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and agreed to by King John of England in order to appease the barons angry at the king. However, neither side respected the document, and increased hostilities led to the First Barons' War. John died in 1216, and his successor Henry III helped amend the document with its more extreme parts cut out. The document was amended again in 1217 and 1225.

With 63 clauses written in Latin, was the first written constitution in Europe. It enumerated specific powers of the barons and other powerful English citizens, excluding most others. Its largest impact was on the legal system, as no longer could anyone be imprisoned without due process of law. 

It served as inspiration for the 1776 Declaration of Independence and the 1789 Bill of Rights, like the Fifth Amendment, protect American citizens' rights to due process of law.

Title: Marco Polo travels the Silk Road
Description: Around the turn of the 14th century, Venetian merchant Marco Polo published his memoir of his travels along the Silk Road, taking him through the Middle East, Central Asia, and China. The memoir was very successful, and invoked a strong interest in merchants to trade with China. Among those he inspired was Christopher Columbus, who centuries later would stumble upon the Americas in an attempt to find a trade route with China.

Polo's claims about his journey are largely unsubstantiated, and the myth that he introduced pasta to Italy is just that. Nevertheless, he provoked interest amongst Europeans to find trade routes to Asia, which would mark the beginning of the Age of Discovery.

Title: Tenochtitlán founded
Description: Tenochtitlán was a large city that would later become capital of the Aztec Empire. At its peak, it was the largest city the Americas would see until the arrival of Europeans. It sported constructions like aquaducts, large temples, and palaces. By the time the Spanish arrived, it likely housed around 200,000 people, making it one of the largest cities in the world at the time.

It was founded in 1325 by the Mexica people. According to Mexica legend, it was founded by wandering tribes who were destined to come upon the site where they would build a great city, akin to the creation myth of Rome. It steadily grew in size and influence until it became the dominant power in the region. The city established trade routes that spanned the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. 

Tenochtitlán had a complex hierarchy of social classes, including divisions of peasants, indentured servants, merchants, nobles, and royalty. King Montezuma resided in a palace with zoos, a garden, and an aquarium. Tens of thousands of people traded in marketplaces on a daily basis.

Tenochtitlán would stand for nearly two centuries, at the end of which Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés razed the city and had Mexico City built in its place.

Title: Zheng He's voyages in the Indian Ocean
Description: In 1403, desiring to project Chinese influence over the Indian Ocean and impress its peoples with the nation's wealth and power, the Yongle Emperor of Ming China commissioned a fleet of 62 ships and 225 support vessels carrying over 25,000 crewmen led by Fleet Admiral Zheng He. This expedition coincided with the beginning of the Age of Exploration in Europe, which was attempting to discover alternate trade routes to China. Unlike these expeditions, Zheng would be following pre-mapped routes. Because his goal was to impress and control, Zheng was given control of a much larger fleet than what would be needed for an ordinary overseas exploration.

Zheng traveled across the Pacific Ocean, stopping at Brunei, Java, Southeast Asia, India, the Horn of Africa, and Arabia. As a display of China's wealth and generosity, Zheng gifted the locals with porcelein, silk, gold, and silver, and in return received exotic gifts like zebras, camels, ivory, and even a giraffe. Generally he and his crew were friendly with those he met, his large force typically being enough to amaze others into submission, though he did wage war against the Kingdom of Kotte.

Upon the death of the Yongle Emperor in 1424, Zheng's expedition was canceled, the new emperor seeing no need to expand China's influence when it was already so wealthy. This left Europe to continue the Age of Exploration. Though Zheng's voyages would not have much of an impact on American history, had China chose to pursue exploring beyond the Indian Ocean and into the Pacific they may have stumbled upon the Americas from the west coast before Christopher Columbus arrived from the east.

Title: Prince Henry the Navigator's seafaring research
Description: Infante Dom Henrique, the Portuguese prince nicknamed Henry the Navigator, wanted to develop Portugal's seafaring capabilities. In 15th century Europe, commerce relied on trade with Asia. The main routes involved traversing the Mediterranean Sea, controlled by Italian merchants. If a nation without their own access to Asia wanted to trade, they would have to pay the Italians as middlemen. Portugal, sitting at the westernmost edge of the Mediterranean, had to pay higher prices for Asian goods, and looked for less expensive alternatives. If they could find a sea route to Asia around the Mediterranean, as Prince Henry hoped, they could get their cheaper goods. He began financing research into sea travel and navigation, research that bore fruit. Their biggest breakthrough was the caravel. While their other ships were built for sailing the calm Mediterranean waters, the caravel sported a deep draft that could sustain the boat through long, rough voyages on the open waters. It could carry heavy cargo, which would be critical for merchant ships. It was fast, agile, and could be manned with a small crew. His team also made improvements to the astrolabe, a tool for precise navigation. With these two inventions in hand, the Portuguese were set to explore the Atlantic Ocean. Within a few decades, Portugal built ports along the African coast and became the first Europeans to sail around the Horn of Africa, granting them access to the Indian Ocean and direct trade with Asia. Prince Henry the Navigator's research would place Portugal at the forefront of the Age of Exploration and established the kingdom as a dominant empire overseas.

Title: Portuguese explore African coast south of the Sahara
Description: Portugal was the European country at the forefront of the quest for a sea route to India. They also wanted to control the vast sources of wealth (from gold, mostly) in Africa. They began financing expeditions in the 1430s, who soon found success in traveling along the African coast. In 1434, explorers brought a sprig of rosemary from West Africa back to Portugal as proof they had made it there. This proved that the mighty Sahara Desert could be passed by sea. Delighted with the results, Portugal began financing further expeditions.

Title: Iroquois Confederacy formed
Description: The Iroquois Confederacy, known as the Five Nations to the English, was an alliance of Midwestern and Northeastern tribes, the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, and Seneca. They appeared to have originated around modern-day Quebec, specifically Montreal, but were driven south due to wars with neighboring tribes. Oral Iroquois history states that the confederacy was formed by Dekanawida ("the Great Peacemaker"), Hiawatha, and Jigonhsasee ("the Mother of Nations"). Dekanawida created an oral pact known as the Great Peace and the three brought it to the five rival tribes, who agreed to band together and protect each other. 

Once the Iroquois Confederacy was formed, they fought little amongst each other and usually fought against other tribes together. This teamwork, along with their frequent warring with nearby tribes, allowed them to become the dominant tribes in the region, with a population of 12,000 at their peak in 1600. When the French and English arrived in North America, the Iroquois became adept at playing them off against each other in order to reduce their presence and distract them from conquering the land. They defeated many of their enemies during the Beaver Wars of the 17th century, such as the Huron and Susquehannock. They initially sided with the French, as they were usually more cooperative than the English in their affairs, but started to side with the English in the 1670s and into the four colonial wars between the French and the English/British. They remained a dominant force in America until the end of the War of 1812, which removed the last of Native American power in the country.

Title: Fall of Constantinople
Description: Constantinople was the capital of the Byzantine Empire, a city that rested in the Marmara Region of modern-day Turkey. In 1453, the city was captured by the Ottoman Turks. The Muslim Turks subsequently banned Christian traders from passing through the city, as part of the long-standing conflict between the two religions. Previously, Christian traders had enjoyed a safe trip from their homeland in Europe to Asia and back through the Silk Road, where they could sell their traded goods. They had been protected by Pax Mongolica, the Mongol Empire's control over Asia. Being blocked from this route was a serious detriment to their businesses, and to the economy of trade-reliant European nations like Spain and Portugal. With the land route closed, Europe began searching for routes to Asia by sea instead.

Title: Age of Exploration
Description: The Age of Exploration was a time period in which European and Chinese explorers sailed the oceans to discover new land and routes.

Portugal was the nation most involved in overseas exploration. Their economy depended heavily on the spice trade with India, so when the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople in 1453 and blocked European merchants from traveling through the Silk Road, Portugal decided to explore other routes to India. This push outside the known world coincided with advancements in seafaring and navigation technology. Discovery of new land and rtade routes had always held the potential for profit, but carried various risks of disease, attacks from natives, and starvation. With this new technology, exploration had become safer and easier, the profit finally outweighing the risks.

Portuguese explorers discovered the Maderia and Azores Islands in the early 15th century, then moved on to the West African coast. By 1498, Portugese explorer Vasco da Gama had reached the Horn of Africa, establishing a Portuguese trade route to the East. Meanwhile, Ming China had sent Zheng He to extend the nation's influence in the Indian Ocean and impress the region's inhabitants with China's power and wealth, though he never reached as far as the Americas.

While Portugal was busy finding an eastern route, Spain funded an expedition led by Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus to find a trade route to the west. Instead, Columbus stumbled upon the Caribbean and even new continents, the Americas. Spain and other European countries, like England, France, Portugal, and the Dutch Republic began sending their own explorers out west to claim the newly discovered land, bringing them into contact with American Indians for the first time in 500 years, at a scale far beyond Leif Erikson's interactions.

The Age of Exploration brought together the two halves of the world that had lived independently for millenia, minus the neglible interactions with American Indians and Leif Erikson. The discovery of the Americas brought about a new age of prosperity and power for the European nations that pursued colonialism. It oversaw the massive upscale in slavery, both of American Indians and Africans, in order to work the newly developed colonial plantations. 

With the discovery of the Americas came the Columbian Exchange, an exchange of ideas, crops, animals, and diseases that would permanently change both the Old and New World. Christianity began to spread amongst the Indians, both voluntarily and coerced. Agricultural tribes began to grow wheat and rice, while Europeans took interest in corn, potatoes, and tobacco. Indian ways of life would be permanently changed with the introduction of firearms from the Europeans, granting a massive advantage to those who traded for them in hunting and warfare. Escaped horses from the Spanish would be captured and bred by Great Plains tribes, who used them extensively for transport, hunting, and war. Diseases like smallpox, as well as European conquests, would devastate American Indian populations to a degree they would never recover from.

Title: Bartholomew Diaz explores the Horn of Africa
Description: In 1487, Portuguese explorer Bartholomew Diaz was sent by King John II of Portugal to travel along the African coast in order to find a viable trade route to Asia. Previously, Portuguese traders had relied on the Silk Road to obtain their goods, but once that road had been blocked by the Ottoman Turks, Portugal began financing expeditions to discover a sea route. In May 1488, Diaz came across the Horn of Africa, which he called the Cape of Good Hope. This was the halfway point between Portugal and India, and was the final part in charting the sea route Portugal would need to trade with Asia, allowing its commerce to flow once more. Upon this discovery, Spain realized that with the Ottomans controlling the Silk Road and Portugal controlling the eastern sea route, they would have to find an alternative route to India if they hoped to trade as well. To this end, it was Spain, not Portugal, that financed Christopher Columbus' expedition westward, and it was in her name that he conquered land in the Caribbean.

Title: Christopher Columbus' first voyage
Description: Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus had the idea that instead of sailing around Africa to reach India, traders could sail west instead. It was common knowledge among the educated at that point in time that the Earth was round, and that you could travel either east or west and arrive at the same point if you went far enough. Columbus wanted to use that to find a new and hopefully faster route to India than sailing around an entire continent. He received a map from Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, a renowned Italian cartographer who shared Columbus' enthusiasm for a westward route to Asia. However, Toscenelli's map was significantly out of touch with reality,  depicting Asia as 5000 miles longer than it was. Toscanelli also suggested to Columbus that there were inhabited islands east of Japan, so the Genoan would likely not even have to travel the full distance before resupplying. Columbus was also influenced by Marco Polo, who centuries ago wrote of the location of Cipangu (Japan) was much farther east than it actually is. Finally, Columbus' own calculations of the Earth relied on measurements made by medieval Persian geographer Alfraganus, who used the Arabic mile. Columbus confused this with the smaller Roman mile he was more used to. All of this together meant that Columbus wildly underestimated the distance he would have to travel. Had the Americas and Caribbean not existed like nearly everyone in the Old World believed, Columbus would have had to traveled four times the distance he calculated.

Nevertheless, he approached several European monarchs with his idea, hoping they would fund his expedition. He first came to King John II of Portugal, who turned him down, correctly thinking that Columbus had misjudged the distance to travel. Columbus approached John II again 3 years later,  but was turned down again, this time because Bartolomeu Dias had just returned with news of reaching the Cape of Good Hope. John II saw that his country was on the verge of reaching India from the east, and saw no reason to fund an expedition to the west. Columbus tried in Genoa and Venice, and his brother Bartholomew tried England, but to no avail. He then approached King Ferdinand II and Queen Isabella I of Spain, who initially turned him down for the same reasons as Portugal. He lobbied the Spanish court for 2 years until the king and queen agreed to fund his voyage, granting him the title "Admiral of the Ocean Sea", allowing him to be governor of any new land he could claim for Spain, and letting him keep 1/10 of the revenue from his expedition. 

On August 3, 1492, he set off for India with 3 ships, the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa María. At 2:00 on the morning of October 12, Pinta sailor Rodrigo de Triana sighted land and informed the crew. Columbus later asserted that he himself had seen the land a few hours earlier, allowing him to claim the lifetime pension offered by the King and Queen of Spain offered for that accomplishment. Columbus had stumbled upon an island in the Caribbean, previously unknown to exist by the Europeans. It was named San Salvador ("the savior" in Spanish), though what island that was is a mystery. The most likely candidate remains Watling Island (renamed to San Salvador Island, believing that they were in fact the island Columbus discovered). There, he was met by several tribes of indigenous people, the largest of which were the Taínos. Believing that he was on an island in the Indies, Columbus called the people "Indians". Columbus observed them for a while and moved on, landing in northeastern Cuba on October 28 and western Hispaniola on December 5. 

The Santa María ran aground on December 25 in Hispaniola and had to be abandoned. There, he was granted permission by Taíno cacique Guacanagarí to leave 39 people to found a settlement, which was named La Navidad, the first European settlement in the New World since the Vikings. The Niña and the Pinta set sail for Spain on January 15, 1493. After pushing through some powerful storms, Columbus and co. landed in the Azores, where half his people were arrested on suspicion of piracy by the island's captain, João de Castenheira. However, he was unable to arrest Columbus or get any of his men to confess, so he released them all within a few days. He arrived in Spain a few weeks later, to much celebration. 

Columbus explained his journey to the Spanish monarchs, in which he insisted he had reached Asia and an island off the coast of China. He also greatly exaggerated the the beauty of the landscape and the riches to be found in the Carribbean. He proceeded to show off his goods from the New World, including gold and jewelry, tobacco, pineapples, turkeys, and a hammock, though there was none of the spices so coveted from the East Indies. Nevertheless, Ferdinand and Isabela were impressed with his findings and financed a second voyage for later that year.

Columbus was far from the first to land on American land. Thousands of years before him, nomads crossed into the region that would become their new home. Nearly 500 years before the Genoan's voyage, Vikings had built a small settlement in Newfoundland. What Columbus did do was begin the union of the two halves of the world in a way they had never seen before. No longer would western lands be legend to the Old Worlders, and never again would American Indians be free from contact with Europeans. For better or for worse, the world would not be the same after Columbus' voyage.

Title: Columbian Exchange
Description: The Columbian Exchange was the exchange of goods, cultures, and (inadvertently) diseases between the inhabitants of the Old World (Europe, Asia, Africa) and the New World (North America, South America, the Caribbean).

Upon first contact between the two peoples, they began trading goods with each other. The Indians traded Europeans crops like corn, potatoes, and tobacco, which would go on to influence European diets, economies, and cultures. For example, potatoes would become the primary edible crop in Ireland, and for decades the primary cash crop for the New World colonies in the modern-day US Southeast would be tobacco.

In return, Europeans brought over wheat, livestock, alcohol, and new technology to the Americas. The introduction of firearms to the Americas dramatically shifted the balance of power between the Indian tribes towards those who possessed them. Guns would replace bows and spears as the weapon of choice for hunting and warfare. Great Plains lifestyles were significantly changed with the introduction of horses to the continent. Some of the steeds had escaped the Spanish and had been captured and bred by Great Plains tribes. Because their diet relied on nomadically hunting fast-moving bison herds, having a reliable, fast, and efficient mount made hunting bison significantly easier.

However, the most important thing brought into the New World were diseases. Europeans at that time tended to live near their livestock, which was a perfect breeding ground for diseases. Many of these diseases, including cholera, measles, the bubonic plague, typhus, tuberculosis, and especially smallpox, were categorized as "plagues", defined by their fast. airborne spread and rapid progrssion of the disease in the body. While Europe was hit hard by these plagues centuries ago, they had since built up resistances to them (especially the plague). In contrast, Indians had no livestock, meaning they were rarely affected by diseases, resulting in a lack of immunity. They had never encountered diseases like smallpox before, so they were caught off guard by its effects. The disease was usually transmitted accidentally; there was no evidence of intentional infection until 1763. Nevertheless, the disease swept through Indian populations, cutting down their numbers by as much as 90, a population drop from which Indians would never recover from.

Though they were transmitted accidentally, they weakened Indian populations enough for European conquerers and colonists to much more easily defeat them in war and take over the land. Europeans also received New World diseases, like syphilis, but were not affected at the same scale as the Indians, as the New World diseases did not spread as rapidly or easily as those brought from the Old World. The Columbian Exchange died down around the turn of the 17th century, when enough of each good from each side of the Atlantic Ocean had been transferred to the other.

Title: Christopher Columbus' second voyage
Description: After the success of his first voyage, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain sent Christopher Columbus back to the Caribbean with a fleet of two naos (large sailboats) and 15 caravels (small sailboats), including the Niña from the first voyage. He was instructed to maintain good relations with the natives. He left Spain on September 24 1493 and landed on an island he named Dominica on November 3. From there, he explored numerous islands in the Lesser Antilles, including Santa María de Galante (now known as Marie-Galante), Les Saintes (Todos los Santos), Santa María de Guadalupe (Guadalupe), Santa María de Montserrat (Montserrat), Santa María la Antigua (Antigua), Santa María la Redonda (Saint Martin), Santa Cruz (Saint Croix), the archipelago Santa Úrsula y las Once Mil Vírgenes (the Virgin Islands), and Virgin Gorda. He then made his way to the Greater Antilles, landing on San Juan Baptista (Puerto Rico) on November 19. 

Three days later, he arrived at Hispaniola, where he discovered the ruins of La Navidad, the settlement formed by the former crew of the Santa María after it ran aground. He learned that the residents had fought with local Taínos led by cacique Caonabo and were killed. Columbus established a new settlement to the north of the island, named La Isabela. He and his men went searching for gold around Hispaniola, but found little. Columbus left on April 24, 1494, and landed in Juana (Cuba) six days later. He explored the island, believing it to be a peninsula of China, as well as Discovery Bay in Jamaica, La Evangelista (the Isle of Youth), and numerous other small islands. He returned to Hispaniola on August 20 and lived in La Isabela for several years. 

Colonists were free to live with and marry indigenous women and take them back to Spain if they desired. There, Columbus sent a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella proposing the enslavement of several hundred Indians to pay for the voyage. His offer was rejected, but in February 1495 he ignored this and captured 1600 Arawaks and given to the Caribs (400 were released due to a lack of space on board). He captured an additional 560 Indians, who were shipped to Spain, 200 dying along the way and another 100-200 falling ill. Isabela was disgusted: she saw the natives as subjects of the Spanish Crown, not slaves, and promptly returned most of them to the Caribbean. 

However, Columbus still needed to pay his investors. To do so, he created a tribute system in the Province of Cicao on Hispaniola. He required every Cicaoan native 14 years old or older to collect a quota of gold for him every three months. Once the individual had met their quota, they would be given a copper token to wear around their neck. Any Indian found without a token would have their hands cut off. There was little gold in Hispaniola, meaning that these quotas were practically impossible to fulfill. Thousands committed suicide, believing Columbus' wrath to be worse than death. 

In March, Columbus led a force of men against the Taínos as revenge for the massacre at La Navidad. They killed and captured, and took Caonabo prisoner, who was then sent to Spain. In June 1495, the settlement was struck by a powerful storm. The Taínos called it a "huricán", after their god of evil (giving rise to the English word "hurricane"). The fleet's flagship, the Marie-Galante, was destroyed in the storm. At this point, many of the colonists were sick, the Taínos' numbers had diminished by two thirds from starvation, disease and Columbus' cruelty, and the Genoan himself was having little luck with his search for gold. Columbus returned for Spain on March 10, 1496.

Title: Treaty of Tordesillas
Description: The Treaty of Tordesillas was an agreement between Spain and Portugal to divide up claims of the New World. It was intended to settle a dispute that arose after Christopher Columbus' voyages to the New World. When the explorer arrived from his first voyage, he stopped in Lisbon to show his findings to King John II of Portugal, who had previously refused to finance his mission. King John was furious at King Ferdinand and Queen Isebella of Spain, and sent a letter claiming that the 1479 Treaty of Alcáçovas granted Portugal control of all land south of the Canary Islands, which included the new land disovered by Columbus. He claimed he was already dispatching a fleet to claim his new prize.

Spain knew that they were no match for the might of the Portugese navy, so she appealed to Pope Alexander VI for help. The Pope was Aragonese (a kingdom of Spain), so he would likely favor Spain, and both Spain and Portugal were Catholic, so they would respect any decision he made. On May 4 1493, the Pope issued the Inter caetera, a bull that granted Spain the right to any land west of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues from the Cape Verde or the Azores Islands. On the 25th of September later that year, he issued the Dudem siquidem, which granted Spain permission to take any land, including islands, ever under the domain of India, even if it was east of the Inter caetera line. Portugal was not mentioned in either bull, meaning that the country could not claim any newly discovered land, even if it was west of the line.

Needless to say, King John was none too pleased with this arrangement. He wanted to control India, a land full of expensive spices and other goods that would enrich Portugal. Not wanting to cross the Pope, however, he instead opened negotiations with King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to allow Portugal to claim some New World land. They signed a treaty in Tordesillas, Spain, which included a new line of demarcation, identical to the Inter caetera line but 270 leagues to the west. This granted Portugal control of the South Atlantic, as well as a small portion of modern-day Brazil. It also allotted all of Africa to Portugal, allowed her to maintain her grip there. Pope Julius II would support the treaty over a decade later.

The treaty was not particularly forceful. It was recognized by no other European country, including England and France. It was not well-defined, being measured in distance from another island rather than in degrees. Spain did not object when Portugal continued to expand across South America, past where the treaty defined its jurisdiction It would be ignored between 1580 and 1640, when Spain and Portugal shared a monarch, and it was forgone entirely when Spanish and Portuguese power diminished to the point where it could not be enforced against other countries, like England, France, the Dutch Republic, and Sweden. Nevertheless, it was responsible for roughly confining Portuguese territory (aka Brazil) to the east of the continent, and vice versa for the Spanish.

Title: Santo Domingo founded
Description: The city of Santo Domingo was built on the island of Hispaniola (modern borders shown) by the Spanish, making it the oldest European settlement in the Americas to be continuously inhabited. It was originally founded by Bartholomew Columbus, and named La Nueva Isabela, after Queen Isabela I of Spain. It was renamed Santo Domingo after Saint Dominic. It became the gateway to the Caribbean and nearby mainland for the Spanish.

Title: John Cabot's voyages to Newfoundland
Description: In 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered the Caribbean Islands while attempting to find a western sea route from Europe to Asia. Spain would subsequently abandon the search to establish colonies in the newly discovered region, leaving the western route to Asia available for other explorers to search for. At this time, no European knew of the continents that laid just west of the Caribbean.

One such explorer was an Italian named John Cabot, who on March 5 1496 received funding from King Henry VII of England to chart the coveted western sea route to Asia. He set sail with his lone ship on May 2 1497 from Bristol, arriving in the New World at what is believed to be Cape Bonavista in Newfoundland on June 24. Like Columbus, Cabot believed he was in Asia, in his case in the northeast. Though it would later turn out that he had not in fact reached Asia, his voyage was historic in that it marked the first time a European had set foot on the North American mainland since Leif Erikson five centuries earlier. However, Cabot and his crew did not encounter any American Indians, and he spent very little time there before sailing back to Bristol.

King Henry VII paid Cabot upon his return and sent him out for another expedition. Cabot set sail in May 1498, this time with his ship filled with goods, presumably for trading with any natives he encountered, as although he had not seen any on his first trip, he had seen evidence of people living there, like an extinguished campfire. However, what became of Cabot during his second voyage is unknown, as he never returned to Europe and was presumed dead.

Title: Vasco da Gama's voyage to India
Description: When Bartholomew Diaz reached the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, Portugal was convinced that it would soon have control over the entire eastern sea route to India. Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama would confirm this control in his voyage a decade later. In 1497 he set sail from Lisbon with four ships and 170 men. By the end of the year, he had rounded the Horn of Africa and was making his way to India. He arrived in Calicut, India on May 20 1498 and traded a few goods with the Indians there. da Gama slowly made his way back to Lisbon, arriving on July 10 the next year.

This voyage would cement Portugal's control over the eastern sea route to Asia. da Gama, along with the work of Prince Henry the Navigator, would assert Portugal as a dominant power in the Age of Exploration and in the Indian Ocean, after China had given up on its voyages in the region. In order to secure the passage, Portugal began establishing colonies all along the African coast. Because the nation possessed a powerful navy, others in Europe had little hope in challenging Portugal's supremacy along the African coast, forcing them to turn west if they hoped to trade with India and China.

Title: Christopher Columbus' third voyage
Description: The objective of Columbus' next voyage was to verify the existence of a continent west of the Cape Verde Islands (which were off the coast of Africa). Prior to this, Columbus had just discovered islands, the largest of which was Cuba. He set sail from Spain on May 30, 1498 with six ships, entering a channel called Dragon's Mouth on the island of Trinidad on July 31, and disembarking at Punta de Arenal (today called Icacos Point) on August 2. From there, he could see the land of a continent unknown to the Old World, which Columbus called Paria (now Venezuela). He explored the waters between Trinidad and the mainland (which he called the Gulf of Paria), then set foot on the mainland at the Paria Peninsula. Columbus investigated the Orinoco River, and observed that it deposited large amounts of fresh water into the Atlantic Ocean, a sure sign of a continent. 

After falling ill, Columbus left for Hispaniola, where he found his colonists in revolt, complaining that Columbus had misled them about the amount of riches to be found there. He was sued, and was forced to make peace with the colonists. In 1500, he was removed as governor and sent to Spain as a prisoner. He was later released, but his governership was not reinstated.

Title: Sir Humphrey Gilbert's failed voyage to Newfoundland
Description: Sir Humphrey Gilbert was a nobleman from England who in 1578 was authorized to start the first ever English New World colony. On September 26, he set off from Dartmouth with a large fleet, but was forced into Plymouth by storms for several weeks, forcing him to postpone the expedition. He would make another attempt five years later, leaving Plymouth on June 11, 1583 and arriving at St. John's, Newfoundland on August 3. He sailed back for England to officially record his claim, but sunk into the ocean alog with his boat partway through, and so his colony ended before it began. While his voyage may have been a failure, it did mark the first time any Englishman attempted to settle in the New World. More importantly, Gilbert's actions inspired his half-brother, Sir Walter Raleigh, to begin his own, slightly more successful, colonial adventure.

Title: <i>A Discourse Concerning Western Planting</i>
Description: <i>A Discourse Concerning Western Planting</i> was a document written by Richard Hakluyt that attempted to convince English Queen Elizabeth I to support the establishment of New World colonies. Hakluyt was one of the only advocates of such an undertaking in England at the time, and was not deterred by Sir Humphrey Gilbert's recent failure to colonize Newfoundland. The document contains 23 reasons for establishing a colony, which include the following:

1) The soil is rich and can produce many valuable commodities
2) The trip from Europe to the New World and back is relatively short and easy (Gilbert's death notwithstanding)
 These points included converting Native Americans to Protestantism, freeing the same people from the 'evil' clutches of Catholicism wrought by the Spanish, creating jobs overseas, reducing commerce between England and Spain (as they could trade with their colonies instead), and just in general sticking it to the Spanish.

Title: Roanoke Colony founded
Description: The first English colony in America, established on Roanoke Island near modern-day North Carolina, was founded by Sir Walter Raleigh. About 100 colonists were sent to the colony, mostly young men in the military, to conduct raids on Spanish ships. They left the next year, and were replaced by another 100 colonists, this time seeking to establish a permanent settlement. It would not last, as 5 years later it was found completely and mysteriously deserted.

Title: Samuel de Champlain explores the St. Lawrence River and eastern Canada
Description: In 1602, French Admiral Aymar de Chaste was given the job of re-establishing the French fur trade in New France. On his voyage over, he was accompanied by French explorer Samuel de Champlain, who would go on to become an important figure in the foundation of Canada. Upon arriving, Champlain joined a fur-trading expedition with François Gravé Du Pont, who taught the explorer about navigating the area. Champlain learned about the Saint Lawrence River, the primary waterway in the region, and about relations with the Indians. During the expedition, Champlain mapped the river and established good relations with the Montagnai Indians, who lived in the area. He sent an account of his journey back home, and joined a second expedition in the spring of 1604. This one was headed by Pierre Dugua de Mons, who was to take over the fur trading business in New France. They eventually settled on an area across the bay from the Saint Croix River in an area that would later be called Acadia (now Nova Scotia). They established a settlement, Port Royal, which Champlain would use as a base to explore the area from. After exploring much of the coast, reaching as far south as Cape Cod, Champlain and Dugua decided the best location for the outpost would be

Title: Virginia Company chartered
Description: Throughout the 16th century, people all across Europe had heard tales from Spanish and Portuguese explorers and settlers of the vast riches in the New World. The two empires were profiting immensely from the trade produced by their new colonies, so it was natural that others would want to join in on colonialism, too. One such contender was England. She was far from the most powerful kingdom in Europe, and was usually too bogged down in wars with Scotland in France to pursue colonialist efforts. She had made a few half-hearted attempts in the late 16th century; Sir Humphrey Gilbert died before he could even build a settlement, and Sir Walter Raleigh's colony on Roanoke Island mysteriously disappeared within a few years of its creation.

In the early 17th century, though, with the conclusion of war with Scotland in 1603 and with pushing from colonialist supporters like Richard Hakluyt, King James I of England made a third attempt at establishing an English presence in the New World. The effort was to be conducted by the Virginia Company, chartered ad hoc on April 10, 1606. Its name comes from Queen Elizabeth I of England, whose nickname was "the virgin queen". The entity was divided into two competing groups: the Plymouth Company was to settle in the north of North America, and the London Company was to take the south. Specifically, Plymouth was granted all land between the 38th and 45th parallels, reaching inland 100 miles, and London was granted the land between the 34th and 41st parallels, also up to 100 miles inland. This produced three degrees of overlap, prompting the additional rule that within that area, neither company was to build a settlement within 100 miles of any already made by the other company.

Both companies landed their first settlers in May the next year, Plymouth with Popham Colony in modern-day Maine and London with Jamestown in modern-day Virginia. While Popham would quickly turn into another English colonial failure, Jamestown would, barely, survive and manage to turn a profit, keeping the London Company in business. However, the Indian Massacre of 1622 saw the death of nearly all of the Jamestown colonists, which was an embarrasment for King James, who had chartered the colony. After a period of debate, he disbanded the London Company and made Virginia a royal colony, which would go on to see success for decades later.

Title: Popham colony
Description: Popham Colony was one of the first colonies established by the English. Specifically, it was built by the Plymouth Company, one of the competing arms of the Virginia Company, who was tasked with buidling a settlement on the northeastern coast of North America. They built it on the mouth of the Kennebec River in modern-day Maine on May 4, 1607, a few days before their rival, the London Company, established their colony of Jamestown. While Popham may have beaten Jamestown for the settlement date, it would lose in longevity, as it was abandoned in July the next year, putting the Plymouth Company out of business. Though, one point of note about Popham is that in order to leave, the colonists built the first ever constructed in North America. Besides that, Popham is little more than a footnote in English-American colonial history, overshadowed by its more successful sister, Jamestown.

Title: <b>Colony of Jamestown founded</b>
Description: The first permanent English settlement in the New World, Jamestown, was founded by John Smith of the Virginia Company for the purposes of finding gold. It was mainly composed of the poor who had fled England because of discrimination. 104 settlers arrived in 1607. They suffered from a variety of diseases, including malaria, typhoid, and dysentery. Their numbers rose to 400 in 1609 after a new shipment of colonists, but was succeeded by a harsh winter referred to as the "starving time," in which all but 65 settlers died. Smith ruled with an iron fist to keep the colonists working so that they may have had enough to eat, but was forced to leave after being injured in a gunpowder explosion.

Nevertheless, it would go on to become a successful town until its destruction in 1676.

Jamestown was the first permanent English settlement in the New World. It was founded by the London Company, a division of the Virginia Company, created on April 10, 1606. King James I of England had heard of the vast amounts of gold, silver, and other riches the Spanish had taken during their conquest of the New World, and hoped to take some of the riches for himself. Attempts in the 1580s had failed, but the tales of vast wealth were too alluring to resist. The Virginia Company was chartered with this intention, sending its first wave of settlers across the Atlantic Ocean in December.

105 men set sail from Blackwall aboard the Godspeed, the Discovery, and the Susan Constant. It took them four months to arrive at the coast, unusually long even for the time. One crew member died on the way over. In April 1607, the remaining 104 men sailed along the coast, naming Cape Henry and Cape Charles. They made their first landing on April 26 on Cape Henry, but did little more than plant a cross. They returned to their ships to prepare to launch their settlement officially. They opened sealed letters sent from the Virginia Company in London, which outlined plans for a council that was to govern the settlement. It named eight members, including the captains of each of the three ships. Another member was John Smith. This was lucky for Smith, as on the voyage over he had been arrested for mutiny and sentenced to be hanged upon arrival. With these orders was able to get a pardon from Christopher Newport, captain of the Susan Constant and now a fellow council member.

The settlers decided that their settlement was to be atop a peninsula they named Jamestown, after King James. Its location made it a good spot to defend against French, Spanish, and Dutch attacks, which were a concern. It was also uninhabited, so there were no Indians or European settlers to fight over it. Finally, it sported a harbor deep enough to anchor the ships, but shallow enough for a quick and easy departure. Settlement was to begin immediately, but just as immediately problems arose. The prospective settlers were aristocrats and were not used to manual labor. The peninsula's uninhabited status also did not prevent a party of Paspahegh Indians rowing in from the mainland to attack the new settlers, killing one ad wounding eleven. Nevertheless, construction on James Fort, their first building, continued, and was finished on June 15. It guarded a storehouse, church, and a few houses. During this time, the settlers also began gathering precious stones and metals like gold from the area. In late June, Captain Newport left for London with their bounty.

While he was out, the settlers began running into more trouble. Though its isolation from the mainland made it easily defensible, the peninsula also had limited game for hunting. The area was also covered in marsh, which supported malaria-carrying mosquitoes. To make matters worse, the James River, the only water source around, was brackish and contaminated with dysentery. Over 135 settlers died from malaria, at the time over 80% of the colony's population. Meanwhile, upon arriving in England he realized that the "gold" he had transported all the way over was in fact worthless iron pyrite. Unperturbed, he sailed back for Jamestown with seventy new colonists and some more provisions. Those provisions turned out to not be enough, and to make matters worse, James Fort burned down soon after Newport arrived.

Newport set out once again for supplies, coming back on October 1, 1608. He brought another seventy settlers, including the first women (though only two) and the first non-English settlers. The latter were workers whose jobs were essential to running the colony, as apparently the existing settlers couldn't handle it. Though all the English settlers were entitled the right to vote on the council members, the Polish workers were not. In response, they went on the first recorded strike in colonial America, and the council caved. The workers made products not just for the colonists to live on, but for export as well. However, it was not enough; Jamestown had been founded with the expectation of gold galore, and the colonists had little to show for over a hundred deaths.

Meanwhile, Smith, making good on his new lease on life, was working hard for his and his fellow colonists' survival. His chief concern was food, and was able to negotiate trade for it with several Indian tribes. One such venture in December 1607 went awry; Smith's party was ambushed and slaughtered by the Powhatan. Smith narrowly survived by using his Indian guide as a human shield, but was easily captured later by Opechancanough, Chief Powhatan's half-brother. Opechancanough decided to let Smith live after the settler gave him a compass. Instead, Smith was taken to the Powhatan seat of government at Werowocomoco on the York River. He was brought before Chief Powhatan himself. When Smith recounted the story seventeen years later, he describes how we was about to be executed, but was saved by the pleas of the chief's daughter, Pocahontas. This story is disputed, however, in part because he had never mentioned it in any previous accounts. By one way or another, Smith was released and rejoined Jamestown in early 1608.

In September 1609, the bag of gunpowder Smith was carrying on an expedition exploded, injuring him and forcing him back to England for treatment. Though one of Jamestown's hardest workers was now out of commission, it turned out to be fortuitous for the colony. While in England, Smith wrote two books detailing life in Jamestown in order to interest the public in the venture and hopefully get some more investments.

Title: John Smith captured by Opechancanough
Description: In December of 1607, Captain John Smith of Jamestown was out seeking food along the Chickahominy River with an Indian guide and a few settlers. He was ambushed by Powhatan warriors led by Opechancanough, the chief's half-brother. They promptly killed the men accompanying Smith, but the captain himself narrowly escaped by using his Indian guide as a human shield. Smith waded into the river, trying to reach his boat to escape, but was overcome by the coldness of the water and was easily captured. In an attempt to spare his life, Smith gifted Opechancanough a compass, a piece of technology the Powhatan had never seen before. The Powhatan were fascinated with the movement of the compass needle that they could not touch. Smith took the opportunity to explain various scientific facts, such as the roundness of the earth and stars, and how the world contained many millions of diverse people. They were at this for an hour, before deciding to bring Smith to Orapaks, a small Powhatan village.

Here, Smith was treated quite well. He watched a variety of dances and was given plenty of food. When a Powhatan boy fell ill, Smith asked to go back to Jamestown to get him some medicine. The Powhatan denied him, instead deciding to raid the settlement. They asked Smith for advice on how to penetrate Jamestown's defenses, offering him riches in return. Smith tried to scare the Powhatan into canceling their raid by exaggerating the settlement's defenses with descriptions of "mines, great guns, and engines". They moved on Jamestown anyway, but retreated when faced when the settlement's soldiers come out to fight them.

The Powhatan then performed another elaborate, three-day ritual for Smith, who was eventually told was to determine if his intentions were friendly. He was then taken from Orapaks to Meronocomoco, where Chief Powhatan lived. Powhatan decided to execute Smith, but at the last second the chief's daughter, Pocahontas, jumped in to protect him. Powhatan called off the execution, and declared that he and Smith were now friends. He permitted Smith to go back to Jamestown to get supplies for a trade. Smith gave the Powhatan two cannons and a millstone, while Pocahontas made frequent trips to Jamestown to deliver provisions that saved the settlers from starvation.

Note that all of this information comes from an account Smith wrote in 1624. He is certainly biased, believing himself and Europeans in general to be superior to the "savage" Powhatan. He also almost definitely exaggerated many components of his story. A large reason for Smith writing this account was to drum up interest in England for the colonialist effort in order to get new settlers and supplies to Jamestown. Therefore, it was in his interest to make life there seem as interesting as possible. What Smith got right versus wrong, and where he told the honest truth, exaggerated, or even fabricated, is debated among historians. What is known for certain is that after this encounter, the relationship between the settlers and Powhatan improved, at least for a few years. It is also the chronologically earliest mention by Smith of Pocahontas, who would continue to play an important role in the town's early history.

Title: Jamestown supply missions
Description: Ever since Jamestown's establishment, it had been suffering from a lack of food and workers. A series of supply missions from England was meant to remedy this. The first came with the return of Captain Christopher Newport, who had traveled to England to sell the stores of gold the Virginians had unearthed. Upon the realization that his gold was in fact worthless iron pyrite, he began gathering new provisions and colonists. He recruited about 120 soon-to-be settlers, and arrived back in Jamestown on January 2, 1608. His arrival was well-timed, as the lack of planning and skills among the settlers, along with raids from the Powhatan, had diminished the colonial population from over a hundred to just 38.

Unfortunately, the supply mission also meant that they had 120 new mouth to feed. A daunting prospect, considering a few days later James Fort burned down, with all their provisions inside. The colonists had not set up sufficient farmland for growing food as it was. Nevertheless, Newport was able to whip the colony into shape. They rebuilt the fort and stationed guards around the crops. Newport himself decided to sail back to England. The colonists had found more gold, and were sure that it was real, unlike last time. This cargo was important, because if Jamestown could not show that it could turn a profit, the Virginia Company would go under, and the colony would not get any more supply missions. He departed on April 10, 1608, leaving over a hundred starving colonists behind. John Smith was able to secure some food from Indians, but it was not enough to save dozens of them from starvation.

On May 21, Newport arrived back in Jamestown. The good news was that he brought more supplies, as well as seventy new colonists. The bad news was that the gold turned out to be fake again, leaving the company's finances in jeopardy. Among the new settlers were the first women in Jamestown, all two of them. The first non-English settlers in Jamestown were also included, most likely from central Europe. They were skilled craftsmen, essential for much of the colonial effort. Among other things, they built a glass furnace, which would go on to become the first factory in America.

Newport was tasked with searching for the survivors of Roanoke Island, a colony whose inhabitants had mysteriously disappeared by 1590. He was also to search for more gold, and to crown Powhatan as a "sub-king" under King James I of England. Newport would fail in all three of these. Instead, he traveled back to England in January 1609, this time bearing non-precious metal products, like glass and tar. However, this was not enough to offset the company's losses, and the higher-ups were becoming increasingly frustrated that the settlers were failing to find the troves of gold and silver the Spanish were enjoying.

Around this time, Captain Samuel Argall of the London Company was tasked with finding a faster route to Jamestown. The usual route was to sail directly south from England to the tropics, then west with the trade winds, a journey of around three to five months. Argall instead sailed to the Azores, then west to Bermuda, then west to the Chesapeake Bay, a journey of about ten weeks. This new route had the added benefit of dodging hostile Spanish ships. This would save the company much time and money supplying the colonies. Upon arriving at Jamestown, Argall found the colonists once again on the brink of doom. This time, the culprit was a rat infestation, which had eaten all their stored corn. Argall gave the colonists much of his food, as well as news that the Virginia Company was being reorganized and that they would be sending a new governor to Jamestown, along with more supplies and settlers. Argall's supplies, while unexpected, would turn out to be critical for getting the colonists through the upcoming Starving Time.

On May 23, 1609, King James I of England made good on his promise. The Virginia Company was given a new charter, whose treasurer, Thomas Smythe, organized the largest supply mission yet. It sported nine ships bearing between 500 and 600 passengers, including women, children, and the new governor, Sir Thomas Gates. They also carried livestock and a year's worth of provisions, including for the new settlers. Newport, who was designated vice-admiral of the mission, was given control of the company's flagship, the Sea Venture. They set sail from Plymouth on June 2.

The suppliers would soon find that they would not be exempt from Jamestown's misfortune. A few diseases had snuck their way on board, including yellow fever, claiming the lives of 32 passengers. On July 25, the fleet encountered a powerful tempest that lasted for three days, seperating the nine ships. Seven of them found their way to the colony, the seventh arriving on October 3. The two holdouts were the Catch and the Sea Venture herself, who had been bearing most of the supplies and prominent passengers. After spending a few days dropping off their supplies, four of the ships returned to England, carrying Argall, Smith (who had been injured in a gunpowder explosion and needed treatment in England), and a few dozen more men. However, no new supply ships were sent for a year. Since most of the supplies had been on the Sea Venture, and the colonists had still not grown enough food for themselves, Jamestown was in dire straits by the winter of 1609.

But what became of the two ships that never made it to Jamestown, the Catch and the Sea Venture? The former was destroyed by the storm, but the flagship survived and was shipwrecked on the island of Bermuda. All 150 passengers and crew members survived the landing, and began salvaging supplies from the Sea Venture. The longboat accompanying the flagship was fitted with the Sea Venture's mast and sent with about ten sailors to find Jamestown, but they were never heard from again. The remaining survivors built two new ships out of the Sea Venture's scraps and local Bermuda wood. The two vessels, the Deliverance and the Patience, set sail on May 20, arriving in Jamestown three days later. They found the colonists all dead or dying. A combination of disease, starvation, and war with the Powhatan Confederacy had devastated the population. Of the 500 colonists living in Jamestown, only sixty remained, with most of those being sick and/or starving. The arrival of the old Sea Venture was of little comfort to the remaining colonists, as they brought 140 mouths to feed and little food to feed them with (most of the supplies had been lost at Bermuda). It was decided, likely by Gates, on June 7 to abandon the colony and sail back for England.

While all this was going on, Smith was keeping busy while recovering from his injuries in England. He wrote (exaggerated) accounts of his adventures in Jamestown. His wild tales of his capture by Opechancanough, the bizzare Powhatan rituals, and his rescue by Pocahontas drummed up enthusiasm among the English, securing investment in the Virginia Company. There was also organization by clergymen to aid the colonists as a humanitarian effort. These resulted in a fourth supply mission, headed by Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr. West was to replace Gates as the governor. He also supplied 150 armed men to the fleet at his own expense. They departed on March 12, 1610, and arrived on June 9. Recall that Gates and the other colonists had decided to abandon Jamestown on June 7, just two days before West arrived. The two groups happpened to run into each other near Mulberry Island in the James River. West forced the group to turn back, which was not received well by the abandoners. Nevertheless, turn back they did, which turned out to be critical to the colony's success.

There would be more supply missions after this, but they were less necessary than in the first three years of Jamestown's existence. By 1610, the colonists were starting to get their acts together. Under Lord West's leadership, the Virginians were able to put up a fight against the Powhatan, and Rolfe's marriage with Pocahontas brought an end to the war. They began farming, trading with Indians, and expanding out from Jamestown. The governors maintained a tight but effective grip on the colony, and Rolfe's decision to plant tobacco saved the Virginia Company from bankruptcy. However, before all this Jamestown was starving, at war, and hurting for good leadership. At such a desperate time, the supply missions ensured that the colony would have a fighting chance. Once given that chance, Virginia would go from a dying town to a fully-fledged profitable colony.

Title: Second Virginia charter
Description: The second Virginia charter was mainly an expansion of the one written in 1606. Under that charter, the London Company was to colonize the central mid-Atlantic coast, while her sister the Plymouth Company was to take the northern mid-Atlantic. Since the Plymouth Company had gone bankrupt in 1608 and their only colony was abandoned, it was now time to reorganize. Virginia was given the authorization to colonize all  land between 200 miles south of Cape Comfort and 200 miles north, approximately between the 34th and 40th parallels. She was also granted all land west of that region, "from sea to sea, west and northwest". This was done to generate excitement from investors, as having so much land to settle and so many natural resources to harvest would surely bring in money.This was important, as the new charter now also allowed merchants to invest in the Virginia Company, so attracting them was key. Despite the large land grant, Virginian settlers rarely traveled very far west, certainly not to the other end of the continent. Once English colonization developed, Virginia was given more reasonably-sized lands and the rest was awarded to other companies. The last point o f note was that in addition to a council, Virginia would be getting a new governor, who was given extensive powers that the Company hoped would straighten the colonists out. The first governor, Lord Delaware, would do just that. After over a decade of success and profit, in 1622 Virginia was suddenly nearly obliterated by a surprise Powhatan attack, forcing King James I of England to once again reorganize the colony, this time directly under the Crown to give it more protection.

Title: John Smith injured in a gunpowder explosion
Description: Jamestown was on the verge of collapse for the first several years of its existence, and John Smith was one of the key players who held it together. He was frequently out of town looking for and trading for food, the supply the Virginians needed above all else. He taught the colonists to fish and farm, and rallied them to work so that they may eat. So it was a great loss for the colony when in September of 1609 the gunpowder keg Smith was carrying suddenly exploded, injuring him. Smith's wounds could not be adequately treated at Jamestown, who lacked a proper doctor and was low on medical supplies. He was transported back to England the next month, and would never step foot in Virginia again.

But that did not mean he was done helping out the colonists. After recovering from his injury, he wrote several books detailing his adventures in Virginia, including the Generall Historie of Virginia in 1624 and The True Adventures and Observations of Captain John Smith in 1630. The former included the famous story of his capture by Opechancanough and rescue by Pocahontas. These exciting accounts created enthusiasm from investors about colonization. All the English had been hearing about before was how the English colonies all failed or were close to failing, so Smith's stories were a nice change of pace. These new investments paid for more supply missions that the colonists depended on.

Title: Lord Delaware becomes Virginia governor
Description: Virginia was the fourth attempt by England to establish a New World colony, and for the first few years of its existence it seemed as if she would meet her predecessors' fates. Unsuitable skills, a lack of motivation and organization, starvation, Indian attacks, and disease had killed hundreds of settlers at a time when there were only hundreds of settlers. The worst of this was the Starving Time. The winter of 1608-09 saw Jamestown's population reduced from around 500 to just 61. King James I of England, who had chartered the Virginia Company to increase English prestige, spread Christianity, and make money, was disappointed that Virginia was doing none of these things. To rectify this, in 1609 he wrote a new charter, which among other things created the office of governor. This governor was to be powerful, and strict on the colonists. He would ensure that the survival effort was organized, that colonists would not slack off, that food would be grown, and that Powhatan attacks would be repulsed.

The Virginia Council nominated Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, better known as "Lord Delaware". He left England along with the latest supply mission on April 10, 1610, arriving two months later. He arrived just in time, as when he approached the James River, he found all of the remaining Virginians sailing back for England, having given up on the settlement entirely. Lord Delaware forced them to turn back, determined to save the colony. He immediately ordered George Somers and Samuel Argall to sail to Bermuda to food. While Somers was unsuccessful (and died in November), Argall was able to catch some fish at Cape Cod in modern-day Massachusetts. While on his way back, he came across a bay, which he named "Delaware" after the new governor. Both the river and state of Delaware are in turn named after this bay, though Lord Delaware himself never laid eyes on any of these.

The next month, Lord Delaware sent Thomas Gates and Christopher Newport to England to ask for more supply missions, and to bring news of the discovery of Bermuda. While they were out, he instructed the colonists to rebuild the church, which was a strong boost to morale. He also began building fortifications around Jamestown to protect it from the Powhatan. They built three: Fort Henry, Fort Algernon, and Fort Charles. We know little about these forts, but they seem to have not affected their defense much, since they were not manned.

Lord Delaware was particularly harsh when it came to Indian relations, even for his time. In July, he ordered Powhatan to return some weapons and English prisoners, which the Indian refused. Enraged, Lord Delaware ordered to cut off a hand of one of their own prisoners. The man was a Paspahegh, a small tributary of the Powhatan Confederacy. Powhatan still would not respond. A month later, Lord Delaware ordered an attack on the Paspahegh village. 70 Englishmen led by George Percy burned houses and crops and killed between 65 and 75. In a move that surprised even their contemporaries, they captured one of the chief's wives and her children, stabbed her, threw her children into the river and shot their brains out.

Title: First Anglo-Powhatan War
Description: A conflict between the colonists at Jamestown and the Powhatan Confederacy. It started after Governor Lord de la Warr attacked the Paspagegh tribe, who were part of the Confederacy. They killed several dozen, burning houses and cornfields, as well as kidnapping women and children. Colonists were attacked in retaliation near the Appomattox River. In 1611, Governor Sir Thomas Dale led several attacks against the Powhatan, and began to expand English territory to the surroundings of Jamestown. In April 1613, the English captured Chief Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, causing the tribe to sue for peace. Pocahontas was then married to colonist John Rolfe, making it the first interracial marriage in Virginia, and led to peace between the two peoples.

In addition, its (non-elected) governor could nullify anything the assembly tried to pass. Nevertheless, it established precedent for future English American colonies to have representative assemblies govern.

Description: An attack by the Powhatan Confederacy on the Virginia colonists that started the Second Anglo-Powhatan War. The Powhatan felt that the colonists were a danger to their way of life, as the English had made numerous attempts to encroach upon Native American land and convert them to Christianity. Powhatan warriors led by Opechancanough shared fruit and meat with the colonists to hide their intentions, then launched a sudden surprise attack, sparing no one they could find. The colonists would later suffer from starvation due to a harsh winter, which killed an additional 400.

Title: Province of Maryland founded
Description: The second Chesapeake colony, Maryland, was established. It was proprietary, meaning that it was granted to a single individual, in this case Cecilius Calvert. Calvert had the power to control trade and initiate legislation in the colony. The charter stressed that "all privileges, franchises, and liberties" be extended to every Englishman in Maryland, Calvert desired a feudal domain in which everyone paid him dues and could not interfere in legislation. He desired Maryland to be a safe haven for Catholics like himself, but Protestants were always the dominant religion there.

Title: Massachusetts General Court reformed
Description: The General Court of Massachusetts was the body that governed the colony. It was a group of people elected by freemen (who had to belong to the church and own land), which was divided into a bicameral legislature in 1636. One element that made it unique is that the freemen of Massachusetts could elect their governor, rather than one being royally appointed like in Virginia.

Title: Saybrook Colony founded
Description: The colony of Saybrook (shown in green), named after Lords Saye and Brooke, MPs who controlled the land's grants, was founded by soon-to-be Saybrook Governor John Winthrop the Younger in order to dissuade the Dutch from claiming the same land. Its residents were strong supporters of Oliver Cromwell, and it was even believed that he would leave England to live there. However, he never did, and the colony suffered hardships because of the Pequot War. In 1644, the colony was merged into Connecticut.

Title: Pequot War
Description: A war between Massachusetts colonists and the Pequot tribe. Exacerbated by escalating tensions between the two peoples, the war started with the murder of trader John Oldham by Narragansett-allied Indians, who sought refuge with the Pequot. In response, the English burned down a Pequot village, while the Pequot's rival tribes sided with the colonists. After several raids on Pequot settlements were carried out by the colonists and their allies, the Pequot and Wongunk attacked the Connecticut town of Wethersfield on April 23, killing 9 colonists. The war climaxed with the Mystic Massacre, where colonists commanded by John Mason and John Underhill burned down a fortified Pequot settlement, killing nearly all Pequot living inside it. Pequot leader Sassacus fled the area with 400 warriors, pursued by Mason (followed by 200 men) to Fairfield, CT. All but 80 warriors (including Sassacus) were captured. Sassacus went to the Mohawk for help, but was murdered. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Hartford. This war essentially destroyed the Pequot tribe.

Title: Roger Williams banished from MA
Description: Roger Williams was a Puritan minister who arrived in Massachusetts in 1631. He claimed that "soul liberty" demanded that people could follow their consciences, free of restriction. He believed that anyone ought to practice any religion they chose, with no government interference, meaning the separation of church from state. He reasoned that faith was not genuine if it was involuntary, which it certainly was if the government forced it upon its citizens. He also believed that Massachusetts congregations end their association with the Church of England.

This rocked the worldview of powerful Puritans in Massachusetts, such as John Winthrop. He, like most Puritans, thought that religion ought not to be questioned lest society collapse. As such, Williams and his followers were banished from Massachusetts. The heretics moved south and established the colony of Rhode Island.

Title: Mystic Massacre
Description: The largest attack in the Pequot War, in which the Pequot Fort by the Mystic River was burned down by Connecticut colonists commanded by Captain John Mason. Both sides had several hundred men on their side, with even the Connecticut colonists' forces primarily consisting of Native Americans. After a failed attempt to invade the fort, Mason ordered his men to set fire to it. The few exits made escape difficult, and anyone who attempted to climb over the wall was shot. Around 500 Pequot died from the attack.

Title: Anne Hutchinson trial
Description: Anne Hutchinson was a woman described as bold-spirited who had unconventional ideas of religion in the dominantly Puritan Massachusetts Bay. Hutchinson believed that Puritan ministers' methods of determining the status of one's salvation or damnation was based on their attendance of church, which was not valid. She held radical beliefs, like that she was a prophetess that God spoke to directly, and that God would destroy both Boston and England. She began holding meetings in her house of several dozen people, usually women, to discuss sermons. Leading Puritans like John Winthrop deemed her to be a threat to society and placed her on trial for Antinomianism (the belief in one's own judgment over that of the church) and sedition (expressing opinions dangerous to authority and the social order). They were also upset that she was not behaving like the typical woman for the time, being outspoken and rebellious instead of quiet and submissive. Though Hutchinson defiantly debated the interpretation of certain Bible passages during her trial, the Puritans remained unconvinced and exiled her and her followers from Massachusetts. They moved to Westchester in modern-day New York, but were killed soon after in a war with Native Americans. The trial demonstrated how individual interpretation of the Bible often led to criticism of the church, which prominent Puritans feared.

Title: Portsmouth founded
Description: The settlement of Portsmouth was founded by a group of religious dissenters from Massachusetts, including Anne Hutchinson, William Coddington, and Dr. John Clarke. The settlers were originally planning on traveling to New Jersey, but were convinced by Roger Williams (founder of Providence Plantations) to live on modern-day Aquidneck Island instead. They purchased the land from the local Native Americans, who had named the area Pocasset. Since the colonists were exiled from Massachusetts due to their unorthodox religious beliefs, the settlement was based around religious tolerance. In 1639, the settlers renamed the land to Portsmouth after the town in Hampshire, England. It later became part of Rhode Island.

Title: New Sweden founded
Description: The colony of Nya Sverige (New Sweden in English, shown in blue) was founded by Sweden. At this point in history, Sweden was a Great Power, and like the other Great Powers, they wanted to expand their dominion into the New World. Specifically, they wanted to profit from tobacco and fur sales, and so in 1626 they founded the Swedish South Company to build a colony. In 1638, the settlers landed along the Delaware River, an area claimed by New Netherland. The New Dutch protested, but were ignored due to the Swedes' military might. He bargained with the local Native American tribes (mainly the Susquehannocks) to gain the land, though the natives later claimed most of it was stolen. They constructed Fort Christina, which they used as a base to expand farther. However, Sweden would lose their only New World colony in 1655 after they started the Second Northern War with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a. This would provide the Dutch with an opening to invade New Sweden and annex it.

Title: New Haven Colony founded
Description: The unofficial colony of New Haven (shown in yellow) was founded by John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton. They were English emigrants who wanted an incredibly strong connection between church and state, the polar opposite of Rhode Island. The colony was riddled with problems, chief among them being the lack of an official charter. Their strong ties to the church also alienated many members of the colony. Davenport, Eaton, and the other founders were merchants who wanted to use to the land to turn a profit, but were unsuccessful in their agricultural ventures there. Starting in 1662, New Haven towns began surrendering their control to Connecticut, and in 1664 the colony was officially subsumed into Connecticut.

Description: The settlement of Warwick in modern-day Rhode Island was founded by Samuel Gorton. He purchased the land from the Narragansett Sachem (chief) Miantonomi. However, other Sachems disputed the sale, and protested to the Boston government. In response, the next year Massachusetts sent militiamen to Warwick to arrest Gorton and his supporters. Most surrendered, and the settlement was instead incorporated into one colony, along with Newport, Portsmouth, and Providence Plantations.

Title: English Civil War
Description: A conflict between English Royalists and Parliamentarians over the structure of the English government. Specifically, they were at odds over the amount of power allotted to Parliament and the Crown, as well as how much the Church of England should follow or distance itself from the doctrines of Catholicism. The House of Commons (the popularly elected house of Parliament, similar to the US House of Representatives) believed King Charles I to be tyrannical, with acts such as passing taxes without Parliament's consent, imprisoning political rivals, and the gradual religious 'decline' back to Catholicism. This led to the monarchist Royalists and their opposition, the Parliamentarians, to fight a civil war. 

New Englanders were mostly Parliamentarians, especially those of Saybrook, while many Royalists could be found in Virginia. Some even came back to England to help fight for their side. In 1649, Parliament captured King Charles I and executed him. The monarchy was declared abolished, to be replaced by 
a Commonwealth and Free State" governed by the people, led by Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell. The monarchy was restored in 1660 with the coronation of Charles II, but with noticeably less power.

The English were struck with a desire for freedoms. It gave rise to the Levellers, the first ever democratic political movement. They proposed a written constitution, entitled the Agreement of the People. It would have abolished the monarchy. the House of Lords (the royally appointed house of Parliament, somewhat similar to the pre-17th Amendment US Senate), and expanded suffrage, overall supporting class equality. An even more radical group, the Diggers, desired essentially a Marxist society, in which there was no government, education was open to all, and land was shared equally among the people. 

Groups like these gave rise to the popular notion that Englishmen were born entitled to certain rights and privileges. Writer Henry Care in 1680 described the English government as a "qualified monarchy," in which everyone and their property was protected by law, while the nobility enjoyed further liberty, making it, in Care's opinion, the best form of government at the time. This helped England see itself as an empire of liberty, much like the US later. These ideas would be taken to the New World by English emigrants.

Title: Kieft's War
Description: A conflict between the settlers of New Netherland (modern-day New York) and several Native American tribes, chiefly the Weckquaesgeeks. In the early 1640s, the New Dutch enjoyed a comparatively peaceful coexistence with the Native American tribes around them. However, in 1638 the Dutch West India Company that managed the colony appointed Willem Kieft as Director-General of New Netherland. 

Kieft was openly hostile towards the Natives, and seeked a punitive expedition for the revenge killing of an elderly resident of his colony by a Native American. He created the Council of Twelve Men, a popularly elected group of advisers to assist him in the expedition. However, they instead urged him not to carry out the attack at all, and suggested the Council be used for political purposes. These thoughts echoed those of most New Dutch, as they did not want war with the Native Americans they lived by. The tribes were also more numerous and controlled the fur trade the Dutch West India Company relied on to turn a profit. 

Despite this, Kieft dissolved the Council and launched an attack on the Weckquaesgeeks, with over 100 soldiers killing as many Native Americans. In response, several tribes formed an alliance, the Wappinger Confederacy, and attacked with 1500 warriors in the autumn, killing many colonists and destroying much farmland and buildings. Kieft attacked again in December 1643, killing 500 Weckquaesgeeks. The New Dutch began to rebel against Kieft, with many colonists straight-out left the colony. Not perturbed, Kieft hired Captain John Underhill to attack the Native alliance. His forces killed over 1000 Natives, with most of the casualties being from the Pound Ridge Massacre in March 1644, the climax of the war. Underhill and 130 men burned a Wappinger village to the ground, killing 500-700.

Despite this great loss, the Wappinger (which grew to 69 tribes strong by the end of the war) continued to harass and raid New Netherlands. In August 1645, the two sides signed a truce, ending the war. In 1647, Kieft was recalled by the Dutch West India Company for his transgressions, but died in a shipwreck on his way back to Europe. Because of the colonists' mass abandonment of New Netherland, the growth of the colony slowed dramatically. The death toll of the war was also quite high, proportional to the populations at the time (the colonial capital of New Amsterdam only had about 800 residents).

Description: A third conflict between the Powhatan Confederacy and the colonists of Virginia. Afraid of the increased expansion of English land, Powhatan forces led by Opechancanough launched a desperate attack against the colonists, killing roughly 500. The colonists retaliated, attacking the Powhatan and their allies in July 1644, followed by an attack on the Powhatan stronghold. Opechancanough was captured and killed, and the Powhatan Confederacy along with him. The war ended with the Treaty of 1846, which made the Native American tribes under the Powhatan Confederacy subjects of the English Crown, as well as marking a boundary between the Virginia colony and the Native American settlements (marked by the red line in the image).

Title: Battle of the Severn
Description: A conflict between Maryland colonists on the Severn River near modern-day Annapolis. After the English Civil War, Parliament appointed two Commissioners to force Virginia to obey Parliament. One was Richard Bennett, who became Virginia's governor, and the other was William Claiborne, who had previously tried to seize the island during the war. They forced Governor William Stone to resign, allowing them to take control of the colony. The general assembly passed dozens of laws under their watch, including the prohibition of Catholics who had taken up arms against Parliament (which included most of them), a repeal of the Toleration Act of 1649, and the prohibition of practicing Catholicism. On January 31, 1655, a ship arrived captained by Roger Heamans. Another then showed up with a letter from Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell addressing William Stone as governor. Stone used this to assert the validity of his former position. The Commissioners appointed William Fuller to head the attack for the coming conflict. Heamans began firing upon boats on the Severn on March 24, and the next day the Puritan forces led by Fuller and the Catholic and moderate Protestant forces led by Roger Heamans engaged each other on the river. After about 30 minutes of fighting, Fuller emerged victorious, even wounding Stone. The assembly remained in power until 1658, when Lord Baltimore's proprietorship was restored.

Casualties:
17 Stone-loyal men killed in battle
4 Stone-loyal men executed
32 Stone-loyal men wounded
2 Puritans killed

Title: New Sweden annexed by New Netherland
Description: The colony of New Sweden was built in an area already claimed by the Dutch West India Company, However, due to Sweden's superior military, they were able to keep the settlement well-defended from the weaker Dutch. This changed in 1655, when Sweden and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth fought each other in the Second Northern War. Sweden was no longer able to keep its New World colony protected, allowing the Dutch to invade and capture it. New Sweden was formally annexed on September 15. However, the New Dutch allowed the New Swedes a degree of autonomy. allowing them to keep their own militia, religion, court, and land. This autonomy would be removed in 1664, when New Netherland was annexed by England.

Title: First Esopus War
Description: A brief conflict between New Netherland and the Esopus tribe. It began with a drunken Esopus man firing off a musket in celebration of completing some work. A group of New Dutch became upset and suspected that they were under attack. On September 20, a mob attacked some Esopus workers. The next day, hundreds of warriors arrived and began destroying crops and buildings and killing livestock. The New Dutch were unable to directly fight the Esopus, so they stuck to burning their enemy's crops. The war ended with the Esopus requesting peace and food on July 15, 1660. However, this did not resolve the tensions between the two groups, and another war would break out three years later.

Title: Navigation Act 1660
Description: Part of the Navigation Acts, it was a law passed that mostly reused the ideas from the 1651 act, but with even stricter measures in place. It required ship crews to be at least 75% English, and for a bond to be purchased as collateral for compliance with the law. It required warships to seize foreign ships and take them to the Court of Admiralty (a court with jurisdiction over maritime laws). It enumerated seven goods that could only be shipped between England and its colonies: sugar, tobacco, cotton wool, indigo, ginger, fustic, and other dyeing woods. It barred foreign merchants from doing business in English colonies. 

It was coupled with several other acts passed at the same time, including:

Customs Act 1660: Passed with the first Navigation Act. It specified how customs duties would be collected, as well as clarifying that for the purposes of the Navigation Acts, an Englishman was counted only as a subject of England, Ireland, or its plantations.

Exportation Act 1660: Passed with the first Navigation Act. Banned the export of wool and wool processing materials. This was made so in order to encourage domestic wool production,

Tobacco Planting and Sowing Act 1660: Passed with the first Navigation Act. Banned growing tobacco in England or Ireland in order to limit competition with the colonies.

Title: Half-Way Covenant of 1662
Description: A religious law established to amend the problem of declining church membership in Massachusetts. While most who came to the colony during the Great Migration were devout Puritans, their children were less enthusiastic, and their children even less so. By 1659, less than half of Boston had full church membership. Puritan leaders had to decide whether or not to uphold their strict qualifications for membership. Doing so would diminish the church's presence, while relaxing their standards would promote more membership but reduce religious purity. The Half-Way Covenant of 1662 was implemented as a compromise. It allowed for the baptism of grandchildren of Great Migration immigrants, thus basing church members to be more based on ancestry rather than conversion. Despite this, church membership continued its decline.

Title: Second Esopus War
Description: A conflict between the New Dutch and the Esopus tribe. The New Dutch were tricked into letting down their defense while trying to negotiate peace between the two peoples. Warriors snuck into New Amsterdam and took control over most of it. The people of New Netherland soon found out that the Esopus had destroyed a neighboring city, and drove the attackers out of New Amsterdam. The New Dutch began receiving reinforcements and allying with other tribes, and by July had enough men to attack the Esopus. However, they soon found that they were still outnumbered, and much like in the first war they stuck to burning the tribe's crops to starve them. The war ended with a battle in early September, when the New Dutch attacked and killed Esopus Chief Papequanaehen, followed by a pillaging of a nearby Esopus fort. The conflict between the two peoples ended, though tensions still remained. The New Dutch learned to remain distrustful of Native Americans, even the Mohawks that had assisted them in the war.

Title: <b>New Netherland captured and annexed by England</b>
Description: Despite frequent pleas from the New Dutch to be supplied with defenses to protect themselves from the ever-increasing colonial power of the English, the Dutch West India Company remained ambivalent towards the future of its colony. In order to remove their maritime rival from North America, King Charles II of England ordered the annexation of New Netherland in March 1664. England claimed that John Cabot, an Italian explorer working for the English, had discovered the land first, giving their country the right to it. On August 27, four English ships arrived at the Dutch colony, and were met with no resistance. King Charles II gifted the colony to his brother, the duke of York, granting him ultimate authority over the land. The colony was subsequently renamed to New York. The duke of York in turn gifted part of New York to Sir George Carteret in order to repay a debt, who named his new land New Jersey after his ancestral home.

Title: Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina
Description: Carolina's constitutions were adopted by the Lords Proprietors, the group of English nobles in charge of the colony. It seeked to establish a feudal society with hereditary nobility (meaning that children of nobles gained the same status), as well as serfs and slaves. However, the colony also adopted an elected assembly and promised religious toleration of Protestants, so as to not discourage immigration. They also had a large headright system, in which 150 acres would be granted to each arriving family, and 100 acres to male indentured servants who had completed their contract. However, what actually arose was the dominance of slavery. Slave owners were promised ultimate authority over their slaves, and invited people to bring slaves with them when they arrived in the colony, such as from Barbados. Thanks to the headright system, these owners would quickly amass large amounts of land.

Description: During the Third-Anglo Dutch War, the colonies of New York and New Jersey were captured by the Dutch (as they were former constituents of New Netherland). However, when the Dutch Republic lost the war, they agreed to give the captured North American colonies back to England. New Jersey was then partitioned into two distinct colonies, East and West Jersey. They were divided by the Keith Line (shown in red) and the Coxe-Barclay Line (shown in orange). The two would later be reunified in 1702.

Title: King Philip's War
Description: A war between the English colonists and the Wampanoag tribe, the latter led by Metacom (aka Philip). Tensions between the two groups raised in 1671 when Metacom refused the terms to a peace deal, and peaked in 1675 when three Wampanoags were charged with murder and subsequently hanged by the English. The Wampanoags allied themselves with the Nipmucks, Podunks, Narragansetts, and Nashaway, while the colonists allied with the Mohegans and Pequots. 

In June 1675, Metacom's allies attacked the Swansea settlement in Plymouth, followed by several more raids in Massachusetts. The New England Confederation (Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, New Haven and Connecticut) declared war on September 9, followed shortly by the Battle of Bloody Brook, where Metacom's allies ambushed colonists, killing 57. The Confederation then launched an attack on a fort full of Narragansetts in the middle of a frozen swamp, known as the Great Swamp Fight. A force of about 1000 militiamen and Native American allies killed nearly 600 Narragansetts and burned the fort, losing 70 themselves. Metacom attempted to enlist the Mohawk tribe, but instead found himself attacked by the tribe and driven away. 

Metacom's forces continued to raid many a New England settlement in the 1675-1676 winter, such as in Lancaster, MA, where a force of 1500 warriors attacked the village and killed over 30, as well as kidnapping the governor's wife, Mary Rowlandson. Metacom continued to Plymouth Plantation, killing militiamen and burning settlements as they went. In April 1676, Metacom attacked Sudbury, MA and killed over 30. Led by MA militia Captain William Turner, the colonists retaliated by killing several hundred Native Americans at Turner's Falls, followed by Hadley and Marlborough. On August 12, 1676, Metacom was killed by forces led by Captains Benjamin Church and Josiah Standish in Rhode Island. His head was then displayed on a pike for many decades. On August 28, Church captured Pocasset Chief Anawan, essentially ending the war in southern New England. In Maine, however, fighting continued until 1678, where the English saw much less success due to their low populations there and from the French backing the Wabanaki tribes there.

The war was the deadliest in English colonial history, both for the colonists and Native Americans. About 1000 Native Americans were sold into slavery as punishment. Fighting continued around Maine until the end of Dummer's War.

Casualties: 
1000 settlers
3000 Native Americans
By percentages, the bloodiest war in American history (5% of colonists and 40% of Native Americans died).

Title: <b>Bacon's Rebellion</b>
Description: An uprising of farmers led by Nathaniel Bacon. It started after scandals arose concerning Virginian Governor William Berkeley. Since the 1640s, he had been running the colony with the help of wealthy tobacco planters, as ell as granting excessive rewards to his supporters. Falling tobacco prices due to excessive supply, compounded by heavy taxes on the crop and little viable land available for those not in Berkeley's circle, left many former indentured servants (a sizable demographic of the colony) quite poor. In 1670, suffrage was revoked for non-landowners. He also refused to allow the colony to expand into Native American territory.

In 1676, there was a confrontation between Native Americans and Virginians. The latter demanded retribution against the tribe, but Berkeley refused. In response, Bacon organized an uprising. He and his 500 men marched on a nearby Native American settlement and killed basically everyone there. Bacon died of dysentery on October 26, and the rebellion was defeated soon after. 23 of his supporters were hanged as punishment. It helped lead to the expansion of slavery because it caused Southern plantation owners to seek out newer forms of labor other than indentured servitude that could be more easily controlled.

Title: Culpeper's Rebellion
Description: A revolt led by John Culpeper in North Carolina over taxes. North Carolinians were harmed by the Navigation Acts, which heavily taxed tobacco, one of the colony's main products. These dues were compounded by the lack of good crops for several years brought on by hurricanes and droughts. The heads of Carolina, the Lords Proprietors, refused to discontinue the taxes, and appointed two men loyal to them to high positions. Thomas Eastchurch became the colony's new governor, while Thomas Miller received the job of customs collector. Eastchurch, in England at the time, was delayed in arriving at Carolina, so Miller appointed himself governor in the meantime. He interfered in local elections and imprisoned his political opponents, including George Durant.

Dissatisfied with the way Miller and the Proprietors were running the colony, a group of forty men decided to depose the new governor. They were led by Durant, John Valentine (the customs collector before Miller), and John Culpeper. They imprisoned Miller, but the interim governor managed to escape to England. He and Culpeper argued their sides before the Proprietors and Parliament. Culpeper was acquitted of charges of rebellion.

After the rebellion, the Lords Proprietors made stronger attempts to establish a real government in Carolina. Durant acted as the unofficial governor, restoring peace and order to the province. When the official governor, Seth Sothel, arrived in 1683, he was found to be corrupt and was deposed. Philip Ludwell became the new governor in 1691, who was ordered by the Proprietors to ignore the Fundamental Constitutions in favor of the original charter. Carolina became stable and continued growing.

Title: Province of Pennsylvania founded
Description: The colony of Pennsylvania was chartered by King Charles II of England to William Penn (after whom the colony was named). The colony was organized to be another religious safe haven. Penn was a Quaker, another religious group persecuted in England. Similarly to Rhode Island, Pennsylvania was quite radical, desiring equality for blacks, women, and Native Americans. Penn disliked slavery, and offered refuge to Native American tribes driven out of their homeland through war. Penn also made sure to purchase land claimed by Native Americans, sometimes even twice when multiple tribes claimed it. Since Quakers were pacifists, it was important that Penn sustain good relations with his Native American neighbors. The colonial government was an appointed legislative council and an elected assembly, with most men being able to vote. Penn sold land at low prices, never turning much of a profit.

Title: Maryland-Pennsylvania-Delaware border dispute
Description: There had been a dispute between the borders of the colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania ever since the latter's charter had been issued. Maryland's northern border was defined in its 1632 charter as the 40th parallel. Pennsylvania's charter, written in 1682, described its colony's southern border similarly: "a Circle drawne at twelve miles distance from New Castle Northward and Westward unto the beginning of the fortieth degree of Northern Latitude, and then by a streight Line Westward to the Limitt of Longitude above-mentioned". In plain English, the border was to be the 40th parallel, except when that overlapped with the area around New Castle, which the border was to go around. This Twelve Mile Circle around New Castle, a town in modern-day Delaware, belonged to James, the Duke of York. King Charles II, who wrote the charter, apparently thought that New Castle laid near the 40th parallel, and was trying to make sure Pennsylvania's land did not overlap with that of the Duke of York, who was his brother. There would be no other reason to specify this Twelve Mile Circle. However, his map must have been inaccurate, because New Castle in fact lies 25 miles south of the 40th parallel. This meant that even if the Twelve Mile Circle ran all the way north, it could never intercept the 40th parallel, so the two segments of Pennsylvania's southern border would not line up, which became a primary cause of the dispute.

The first problem arose on September 16, 1681, when William Penn, proprietor of Pennsylvania, sent letters to the residents of Baltimore and Cecil Counties explaining that they would not have to pay taxes to Maryland, under the (incorrect) impression that these areas were within his territory. Therefore, when Cecil Calvert, 3rd Lord of Baltimore and proprietor of Maryland, sent tax collectors to the region, they were met with strong resistance by those who thought they didn't have to pay. Calvert, desperate to resolve the issue, called for a meeting with William Markham, the lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. Markham had supposed to meet with Calvert several times previously, but had canceled due to illness. After postponing again, Markham met with Calvert in Upland, just north of New Castle, in September. Both parties brought surveyors, who eventually agreed that the latitude of the site was 39 degrees, 47 minutes, and 5 seconds. They arranged to meet at New Castle the following day to find the 40th parallel, but Markham never showed. He sent a letter to Calvert explaining that he would not accept the 40th parallel as a boundary because it laid more than 12 miles north of New Castle, which would violate the Pennsylvanian charter. It would seem this resolve was not going to come to the speedy end Calvert wanted.

Meanwhile, Penn discovered that his colony would have no access to the Atlantic Ocean. However, the Twelve Mile Circle did have access, as New Castle itself laid on the Delaware River, an easy entrance to the ocean. Luckily for Penn, he was friends with the Duke of York, so he was able to convince him to permanently lease the Twelve Mile Circle to him, which was formalized on August 21, 1682. Three days later, the Duke granted Penn all his land south of the circle, which consisted of the Deale and St. Jones counties (renamed to Sussex and Kent, respectively, on December 23). These counties, along with New Castle County (the Twelve Mile Circle), were formally annexed into Pennsylvania on December 4, and became known as the Lower Counties of Pennsylvania. Calvert objected to this; the Maryland charter entitled him to the entire Chesapeake Peninsula, the lad between the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. Yet Penn had just purchased the Lower Counties, which surely laid on the peninsula, though their borders were as unsurveyed as the northern border. Now the dispute involved the 40th parallel, the Twelve Mile Circle, and the Chesapeake Peninsula.

Another meeting was called, this time with Penn himself. He and Calvert met at Annapolis on December 12 to discuss this triple threat of land disputes. First, the issue of the Twelve Mile Circle. The Pennsylvania charter defined the circle as "drawne at twelve miles distance from New Castle", indicating an arc with a radius of twelve miles, as Penn maintained was the case. But Calvert claimed that the "twelve miles distance" actually referred to circumference, producing a noticeably smaller arc. As for the Chesapeake Peninsula, Calvert insisted that his claim to the area was the more legitimate, as St. Mary's City, which was founded by the first Maryland settlers, had been on the western shore ever since 1634. Penn said that it only established legitimacy for the western half, and since Calvert never built any towns to the east, that area was definitively in the Lower Counties. At the very least, the two agreed that the 40th parallel was to constitute most of the northern border between the two colonies. The disagreement here was over how to measure where this parallel was. Calvert suggested using the generally-accepted method of using a sextant, while Penn wanted to use an elaborate and ultimately inaccurate method to measure a line 2 degrees and 55 minutes from Cape Charles. It is believed that Penn insisted on this method because he knew his line would give him an extra 29 miles south of the actual location of the parallel, granting him his much-desired access to the Chesapeake Bay. Even if they had gone through with Penn's idea, a line due north of Cape Charles would run into the bay, an unacceptable boundary. They were ultimately unable to make any headway on any of the borders.  They met again at New Castle in May 1683, but again achieved nothing. The only point of note was that Penn offered to follow along with Calvert's sextant plan if he got control of the headwaters of Chesapeake Bay, but the Maryland proprietor declined.

Seeing as their negotiations were going nowhere, they brought the issue to the Commissioners for Trade and Plantations in England. These commissioners were officers of the new king of England, James II. This King James also happened to be the former Duke of York, Penn's old friend. Penn had assured himself an easy victory because of this, but evidently his cordiality with the king was not enough to convince the commissioners of his initial arguments. Penn revised his strategy; now he argued that the Maryland charter only gave Calvert "uncultivated lands" on the Chesapeake Peninsula. The Dutch had already settled on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Peninsula in the early 17th century, so Calvert was not entitled to that land. This argument found more success with the commissioners, who voted that Maryland indeed was not entitled to the east of the peninsula. On November 7, 1685, King James issued a compromise decree. He advised splitting the peninsula by a line heading south from the 40th parallel and a line heading west from Cape Henlopen, which was located at the entrance of Delaware Bay. The rest of the border was to remain at the 40th parallel, a ruling in Maryland's favor. In 1688, King James issued a new charter to Pennsylvania, formally defining the borders of the Lower Counties in accordance with this decree.

It is at this point that something important should be disclosed: that of surveying. As you can probably tell, colonial charters were not the most specific or accurate when it came to border definitions. In order to establish legitimate ownership of a region, that region was supposed to be surveyed and monuments were supposed to be placed marking the boundary. However, Calvert had continued to neglect having Maryland's northern boundary surveyed, which was part of the reason why this whole dispute was a dispute in the first place. Even in the 1680s, after King James' decree, Calvert still would not have the land surveyed, even though it would have ended the dispute in his favor. The other way to establish legitimacy over a land claim was to settle loyal families in the region, but Calvert did not do this until it was too late, even though his colony had a fifty year head start on Penn's.

The border dispute would rear its head again thirteen years later. On July 20, 1701, the Lower Counties petitioned the Pennsylvania Assembly for a separate legislature and administrative officers. This was a long time coming; New Castle and Philadelphia often conflicted commercially, and the residents of the Lower Counties and Pennsylvanians were ethnically and religiously distinct. Pennsylvanians also disliked how the Lower Counties disrupted the government. Penn wanted to balance the representation of the Upper Counties (Chester, Philadelphia, and Bucks) aka Pennsylvania Proper, with that of the Lower Counties. Therefore, assent from both the Upper and Lower Counties was required before laws could be passed, and the meeting place of the legislature itself was to alternate between Philadelphia and New Castle. Upper County residents, who vastly outnumbered their southern neighbors, resented the Lower Counties having an undue influence on their legislation, so they were more than willing to grant the petition. The Lower Counties, later renamed to Delaware, would be self-governing evermore.

Although Delaware's borders had been officially defined in Pennsylvania's 1688 charter, they had not been surveyed (much like every other border in this saga). Previously, this was not much of an issue, as there were no major settlements in that area anyway. Now that the area had become its own colony, however, there was a more pressing need for definitive boundaries so settlers would know where they could go. To this end, on August 28 Penn commissioned a survey of the border between New Castle and Chester Counties. This boundary was to be an arc of a circle with a twelve-mile radius centered around New Castle and extending from the Delaware River westward 120 degrees, finally defining the Twelve-Mile Circle. The surveyors, Isaac Taylor of Chester County and Thomas Piersons of New Castle County, began on September 24 heading out twelve miles from New Castle (though it was later found that they went 2000 feet too far out). They then measured a series of four circular arcs, each separated by a natural boundary like a creek, which resulted in not quite a circle, but a decent approximation. They finished on October 4. However, it took until 1715 for the Pennsylvania Assembly to approve the survey as the boundary between Chester and New Castle Counties, and 1719 for the Delaware Assembly to do the same. The matter of the Twelve Mile Circle seemed settled for the moment, but the rest of the Maryland-Pennsylvania border had yet to be surveyed.

As Calvert and Penn fought legal battles over the land, settlers in the disputed territory itself began fighting physically. The trouble began in 1722, when the Pennsylvania Assembly began establishing a settlement by the Codorus Creek in modern-day York County, PA after hearing rumors that Maryland was trying to do the same. Relations between the two colonies quickly deteriorated, and both began rushing to settle, even after a 1724 royal proclamation expressly prohibiting this until the dispute was resolved. One such settler was John Wright, an English-born Quaker leader, which of course meant he settled in the name of Pennsylvania. In 1727, he built two dugout canoes and started a business ferrying settlers across the creeks. Pennsylvanian settlement, and subsequently Wright’s ferry service, increased in 1730, including many Dutch families. Not to be outdone, Marylander Thomas Cresap set up a rival ferry business four miles south of Wright’s Ferry near modern-day Washington Boro, PA.

Calvert worried that if he did not act fast, he would lose the disputed territory to settlers before he could settle the matter legally. He granted Cresap title to 500 acres along the mostly already-inhabited west bank, in open defiance of the 1724 proclamation. The Pennsylvania Dutch families along the west bank were not allowed there, either, but they were merely living on the land without title, which was less of an issue than selling land without title. But now that Cresap had "official authority" over the land, he approached the Dutch families, offering to sell it to them as a part of Maryland. Many of these families accepted the deal, as holding title over the land was better than not. They had the best of both worlds; if Maryland won ownership of the land, then they had bought the land legitimately, and if Pennsylvania won, the colony would surely not kick out their own settlers. It worked for Cresap because he was essentially getting settlers trying to claim the land for Pennsylvania to admit they were in Maryland, undermining their rival's legitimacy to the area. He also began collecting quit-rents, a kind of land tax often used in British colonies. Pennsylvanian authorities, now catching wind of this, were of course mad that Maryland was profiting off of Pennsylvanian settlers using land they weren’t allowed to own. They wanted to stop, or at least counter Cresap's schemes, but they also didn't want to break the royal proclamation. They had Wright’s Ferry issue tickets to new settlers that promised to award title when the area was officially opened for settlement. This was still not allowed, but it was less egregious of a violation that Cresap's new land business.

It was only a matter of time before the tension erupted into violence. In late October, Cresap and one of his workmen were attacked by two Pennsylvanians, one of whom swore he would kill the ferryman. Cresap narrowly escaped and was rescued by a friendly Indian. It was later revealed through testimony that the target of the attack was actually Cresap’s workman, who was wanted in Lancaster County, PA. However, Cresap insisted that Pennsylvanian officials had conspired with the attackers and Indian tribes to attack the ferryman for his business. Meanwhile, both Pennsylvanians and Marylanders, including the Chief Justice of Cecil County, and Isaac Taylor, the Pennsylvanian surveyor of the Twelve Mile Circle, had been secretly surveying the disputed region, stirring up more tension.

This conflict had been going on for so long that both Charles Calvert and William Penn had died by this point. Penn's three children had inherited their father's land, and the new proprietor of Maryland was Charles Calvert, 5th Lord Baltimore (not to be confused with the previous Charles Calvert, who was 3rd Lord Baltimore). This new generation would continue the fight over the Twelve Mile Circle, the 40th parallel, and the Chesapeake Peninsula. In 1731, Calvert petitioned the Committee for Trade and Plantations to force the Penns into settling the dispute. The Committee held many meetings discussing the borders. Calvert, like his father, insisted that the border laid at the 40th parallel. The Penns had given up on their father's idea of badly measuring the 40th parallel, instead claiming that the true colonial border laid fifteen miles south of Philadelphia. During the border dispute, it had been discovered that Philadelphia, Pennsylvania’s primary city, actually lay south of the 40th parallel. It had been built in 1682, before the border dispute had really began and had been operating under Pennsylvania’s borders as defined by the colony's charter. If the 40th parallel were to become the border, it would leave Pennsylvania in an awkward situation where its main city, population, and source of revenue and prestige would no longer be in Pennsylvania. It may seem like Penn had brought this upon himself by not waiting until this conflict's resolution before building Philadelphia. However, in those days when an incident like this could not be resolved in a timely manner (and we can see here it certainly hasn't), building towns and settling residents is a good way of establishing legitimacy over a region. Philadelphia therefore strengthened the Penns' claim to the region. Even Calvert conceded this point, primarily pressing his land claims west of the city. He likely expected the Committee to rule the border as the 40th parallel, with some kind of exception for Philadelphia. The Penns wanted to take this implicit concession even further by supposing that this exception for Philadelphia extended all the way west. Plus, this line intersected the Twelve Mile Circle, so this assertion had some legitimacy through the Pennsylvania charter. After much deliberation, the Committee drafted Articles of Agreement, their final decision. The official demarcation line was to run west from Cape Henlopen to the middle of the Chesapeake Peninsula, then north to a point tangent to the Twelve Mile Circle, then around the circle until it was north of the tangent point, then north until it intersected an east-west line 15 miles south of Philadelphia. This decision was a huge gain for Pennsylvania. Maryland was officially ceding its claim to the Lower Counties on the Delaware, although they had not held any legitimate claim to it since 1701 anyway. More importantly, Maryland had suddenly found its 40th parallel claim, which had been validated in 1685, cast aside. Yet both colonies agreed to sign the ruling on May 10, 1732 even though  the new line resulted in the loss of 3700 square miles for Maryland. It is unknown why Calvert agreed to such an unfavorable decision, but agree he did.

The agreement also called for a Commission of seven for each party to demarcate the border, either with natural objects or stones. The first meeting was not held until 1734, a full two years after the agreement was signed. The Commissioners were selected, which included both colonial governors. They were meant to settle the center and size of the Twelve Mile Circle. You may recall the matter was supposedly settled in 1701, but only Pennsylvania and Delaware had ratified the survey, not Maryland. Their Commissioners had recycled the 3rd Lord Baltimore's claim that the "twelve miles" referred to the circle's circumference, while the Pennsylvanians maintained that it was the radius, like how it was surveyed in 1701 (each of which “coincidentally” gave their side more land). Also, the center was to be New Castle, but where in New Castle, exactly? Was it to be the physical center, the town square, the church, or some other point of interest? Eventually, they gave up and went home, leaving only a joint statement saying they couldn’t agree on anything.

To make matters worse, Calvert suddenly claimed that the Articles of Agreement he had signed contained geographical inaccuracies, and refused to enact it. He was not wrong; the map the agreement used located Cape Henlopen incorrectly. The false map, which ironically had been presented by Calvert in the first place, placed Cape Henlopen where modern-day Fenwick Island actually is. The error was costing Maryland 800 square miles more than Calvert had signed up for. The Penns pressed the advantage, saying that even if the map was inaccurate, they had all agreed to it, Calvert included. Not to be deterred, in 1735, the 5th Lord Baltimore opened a chancery suit over the issue, a chancery suit being one to be resolved using fairness and equity as a guide instead of common law. This suit would go on for 15 years.

Meanwhile, conflict between the settlers was escalating. Cresap obtained patents for his ferries and began raiding farms, shooting one farmer’s horses and seizing another’s plantation. Several dozen men, led by the Lancaster County sheriff, approached Cresap’s house and demanded he come out so he could be arrested. The ferryman refused, and when the crowd forced their way into his house, he opened fire, hitting Deputy Knowles Daunt through the door. No one else tried to force their way into Cresap's house after that. Daunt died of his wounds, prompting Pennsylvania Deputy Governor Patrick Gordon to demand Cresap be arrested for murder. Instead, Maryland Governor Samuel Ogle made Cresap a militia captain. On the night of November 25, 1736, Sheriff Samuel Smith had decided he had had enough of Cresap’s mischief, and gathered a posse of 24 armed “non-Quakers” to arrest him. Cresap refused to surrender, so the posse set his house on fire. He attempted to escape to the river, but members of the posse jumped in his boat before he could get away. Cresap shoved one of his attackers overboard and yelled, “Cresap’s getting away”, prompting the rest of the posse to beat “Cresap” until they discovered the trick. The real Cresap was cornered in Lancaster, where the blacksmith approached to put him in chains. Cresap knocked him out in one blow, but even that was not enough to prevent his arrest. He was hauled to Philadelphia and paraded through the streets before being imprisoned. Cresap, apparently still in good spirits, joked that Philadelphia was “one of the prettiest towns in Maryland”.

Following Cresap’s arrest, Maryland petitioned King George II of England to break up the conflict until  the chancery suit was resolved. King George followed through with the petition nearly a year later, on August 18, 1737, ordering both sides to end their hostilities. This proclamation was unheeded, even in Cresap's absence, resulting in another round of petitions to the king. To end the violence, the royal Committee for Plantation Affairs arranged for the two colonies to sign a peace treaty in London on May 25, 1738. Both sides agreed to stand down until the chancery suit had ended. This marked the end of conflict between settlers in the region, known as Cresap's War, but the legal battle over the land was far from over.

The agreement also declared a temporary border 15.25 miles south of Philadelphia to the east of the Susquehanna River, and 14.47 miles south of Philadelphia to the west. These lines were to be accepted immediately and without question. The temporary border was held without much conflict while "the Great Chancery Suit" dragged on. In 1750, High Chancellor Lord Hardwicke finally issued his verdict. The northern boundary of Maryland was to continue to be 15 miles south of Philadelphia, as in the 1732 agreement. Commissioners were to be appointed within the next three months to survey the boundaries, which was to be completed by 1752. He also ruled that the infamous circle around New Castle had a radius of twelve miles and was centered around the center of New Castle. Cape Henlopen, for the purposes of the 1732 agreement, was to be where the corresponding map said it was, even though it was inaccurate.

The Commissioners met for the first time in New Castle on November 14, 1750 to survey the Twelve Mile Circle. They decided the courthouse was at the center of town, but were unable to proceed further because of logistical disagreements. The Marylanders wanted the line to run up and down hills and valley, while the Pennsylvanians wanted to use a level line. They decided to bring the matter to the High Chancellor and wait for his verdict.

At the same time, another team was dispatched to survey the southern Delaware boundary, which would come to be called the Transpeninsular Line. They were to lay this line all the way across the peninsula, and find the midpoint, which would determine where the western border of Delaware began. They began in April 1750, and on June 12, had reached Slaughter Creek, 66 miles west of the aptly-named Initial Point on the Atlantic coast. Slaughter Creek, a small waterway that fed into the Chesapeake Bay, was also where a new dispute arose. Recall that the 1732 agreement placed the opening of the Chesapeake Bay as the terminus of the Transpeninsular Line. The Marylanders wanted to stop at the creek, claiming that it counted as part of the bay, but the Pennsylvanians wanted to continue to the main part of the Chesapeake because Slaughter Creek was a mere two feet at low tide and so didn't deserve to be the border. The main waters of the Chesapeake were three miles further west, which would make the southern border 33 miles long instead of 34.5. It should go without saying that both parties were arguing in favor of the situation that gave their colony the most land. They, like the Twelve Mile Circle surveyors, referred to the High Chancellor, and while waiting for his response began placing the stone markers along the area they had already surveyed.

It would not be for another ten years that the High Chancellor resolved both disputes. The Twelve Mile Circle team was to use a level line, and the transpeninsular team was to extend the line the extra three miles. There were no more disputes after the July 1760 decision. At long last, the Twelve Mile Circle and Delaware's southern boundary had been properly surveyed and demarcated.

But this was not quite the end. There were still two lines left to survey: the Pennsylvania-Maryland east-west line that ran due west of the Twelve Mile Circle, and the Maryland-Delaware north-south line that ran between the Twelve Mile Circle and the Transpeninsular Line. These proved more difficult to survey than the previous two (physically difficult, not difficult due to the bickering that had prolonged this dispute for the last eighty years). After several failed attempts, the surveyors were recalled and two English scientists were hired instead. Their names were Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, and they arrived in Philadelphia on November 15, 1763. They started on Maryland's northern border, traveling fifteen miles south from Philadelphia and building an observatory for reference. They then headed west until the Indians in the region stopped them from progressing further. In September 1764, they surveyed the shorter north-south line. After stopping in November to attain the Commissioners' approval for their survey, Mason and Dixon began placing monuments under the Commissioners' supervision. The whole endeavor concluded on October 9, 1767, and the pair of surveyors left for England on September 11 the next year. Calvert and the Penns petitioned King George III of England to approve the new boundaries, which he did on January 11, 1769, finally putting the 85-year-old dispute to rest.

Or at least, that should have been the end, but it appears that this border dispute refused to die. It turned out that the north-south line did not quite match up with the Twelve Mile Circle, leaving a small wedge between the circle and the lines Mason and Dixon surveyed with an unknown owner. Maryland certainly did not own it, as it was east of Mason's and Dixon's lines, and Maryland was only entitled to land to its west. As for the other two, Delaware was still technically just a part of Pennsylvania and not a separate colony, so there was no pressing need for the Penns to determine which part it belonged to. Both Pennsylvania and Delaware claimed the land, but no official conflict arose over it, likely because it was only one square mile. It was not until 1849 that Pennsylvania was reminded of the Wedge by a recent survey and once again claimed the Wedge. This survey, conducted by Lieutenant Colonel James D. Graham, appeared to decide the Wedge in Pennsylvania's favor. But the matter was not resolved until decades later. Due to the uncertain jurisdiction over the area is became a common place for illegal activities like dogfights and duels around the early to mid-19th century. 

In 1889, Delaware and Pennsylvania finally resolved to appoint commissioners to resolve the issue of the Wedge. On March 16, three years later, Colonel W.C. Hodgkins of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey met with Philadelphian Benjamin Smith and Wilmingtonian Daniel Farra in Philadelphia to begin discussing the survey. Their goal was to find authentic markers of the Twelve Mile Circle that were written about in the 1701 survey report. After a long and thorough search, they were only able to come up with four, including:

1. The remains of an old house on the Delaware River where the 1701 survey concluded.
2. The boundaries of some farms between the Brandywine Creek and the Concord Pike, farmland that was supposed to end at the state border.
3. An 'S' curve in the Brandywine Creek described as the northern terminus of the Twelve Mile Circle in the 1701 report.
4. An old hickory stump that marked the line between Chester County, PA and New Castle County, DE.

Due to the lack of markers, the surveyors could not exactly determine where the Twelve Mile Circle laid. They decided to draw two arcs. One started at a point on the extension of the east-west line twelve miles from the New Castle courthouse (the center of the circle) and continue to the hickory stump. The second would start at the stump, pass through the Brandywine's 'S' curve, and would end on the remains of the old house. They began the survey that year and finished in 1893. New, larger monuments were laid along the new arcs, with one side labeled 'P' for Pennsylvania and the other 'D' for Delaware. The starting point for this first arc was 2000 feet to the east of the previously accepted point of intersection between the two states, creating a "horn" running from the east-west line to the stump, producing a second area whose ownership was in question. Luckily, the Commissioners quickly resolved them, awarding the Horn to Pennsylvania and the Wedge to Delaware. The survey report, and therefore the Commissioners' allotments, were ratified by the Pennsylvania Assembly in June 1897, but Delaware held out. There were some people living in the Horn who considered themselves Delawarean, and did not appreciate suddenly finding themselves in Pennsylvania. It took them until March 1921 to ratify it. In June later that year, Congress, too, ratified the survey, at long last bringing a 100% close to the story. So even though this long-standing border conflict effectively resolved in 1769, it could be argued that it lasted all the way until 1921.

The pair of lines that Mason and Dixon surveyed, particularly the one running east-west, would go on to be culturally significant. The first instance of it being called the Mason-Dixon Line, of course after the two surveyors, was in 1820, during the Missouri Crisis debates. Congress had noticed that this (relatively) straight line just so happened to form a neat boundary between the northern antislavery states and the southern pro-slavery states on the east coast (which received most of the focus, as most Americans lived there). At a time when the debate over slavery was becoming a national issue, the line became a handy way to refer to the divide between the North and South. It also happens to be the origin of the South's nickname of Dixie. Though referred to less today, the Mason-Dixon Line is still known as the dividing line between the North and South, but it also serves as the end to a near-century of border disputes between Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Delaware.

Title: Gove's Rebellion
Description: A failed uprising led by Edward Gove in New Hampshire. Many colonists were upset that they had a royally appointed governor, Edward Cranfield. In 1683, Cranfield dissolved the colony's locally elected council after he was unable to pass revenue bill, assuming direct control over New Hampshire. Gove, a member of the former council decided to rebel against Cranfield, and gathered around fifteen supporters. They were caught by the militia, most of whom were set free. Gove, on the other hand, was convicted with high treason and was imprisoned in the Tower of London. He was sentenced to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, but was set free after three years instead.

Title: Dominion of New England founded
Description: The giant colony, named the Dominion of England, was composed of several previous colonies in America, namely Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Plymouth, New Hampshire, New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey. Former Governor of New York Sir Edmund Andros was appointed to head the new colony, with no elected assembly. Andros established a tyrannical rule, enforcing taxes the colonists did not consent to, declared that all land grants were null and void unless he said otherwise, and required religious toleration of all Protestants, endangering the strict Puritan social order. The colony would not last long, being dissolved into its previous components during a series of revolts in 1689 spurred by the Glorious Revolution.

Title: King William's War
Description: A conflict fought between two alliances, both of a European power and a Native American ally; one consisting of England and the Iroquois Confederacy, and the other composed of France and the Wabanaki Confederacy. It was the North American theater of the Nine Years' War, and was the first French and Indian War. 

The English-allied Iroquois controlled the fur trade, and by 1688 refused to trade with New France to secure economic dominance for themselves and their allies. The French proceeded to raid the Seneca lands, prompting an English raid on Lachine. Meanwhile, French-friendly tribes in French Acadia allied to form the Wabanaki Confederacy as revenge for losing King Phillip's War. After the Nine Years' War broke out, fighting began between the two factions in North America.

After some skirmishes around modern-day Maine, Wabanaki warriors in June 1689 raided New Hampshire and successfully defeated the English force dispatched to counter them. The French then destroyed the English fort at Pemaquid. English forces led by Major Benjamin Church began to push the Wabanaki out of Maine, but were defeated and the residents of Maine were nearly all massacred by the French and Wabanaki.

By 1690, British commander Sir William Phips captured Port Royal, the capital of Acadia. Brutal fighting continued between both sides for the next four years. In 1696, the French-Wabanaki alliance raided Pemaquid, followed by the destruction of most English settlements in Newfoundland. The English colonists were weak and those in New York did little to help their Iroquois allies. In 1697, the French and English signed the Treaty of Ryswick, restoring captured lands to their previous states and ending the war.

Title: Glorious Revolution
Description: A coup in England that saw the Parliament gain ultimate authority over the government, rather than sharing its power with the reigning monarch. In 1687, King James II of England declared religious tolerance of Protestant Dissenters and Catholics, spurring the English people to worry about a tyrannical Catholic king in power. Aristocrats encouraged William of Orange, a Dutch noble and husband of King James II's (Protestant) daughter, to usurp the throne. William arrived in November 1688 backed by over 20,000 troops, most of them Dutch. Most aristocrats abandoned James, causing him to flee. William of Orange became King William III of England. The 1690 Toleration Act allowed Protestant Dissenters to practice freely, though only Anglicans could hold office. The American colonies saw a tightening of religious control over Christian minorities.

Title: <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>
Description: English philosopher John Locke wrote <i>Two Treatises of Government</i>, an influential work of political philosophy from the Enlightenment. 

The first treatise was less important, being a direct reply to Sir Robert Filmer's work, Patriarcha, in which he argues for the divine right of kings, because their power was descended from Adam, biblically the first man and king. Locke believed this contradicted common sense, as this divine grant could not be found in any historical record, and rebuked the idea that a contract between God and Adam could be binding for the latter's descendants many generations later. 

However, Locke is more known for the second treatise. He wrote that political power was driven by moral obligations; the government had to make laws for "the public good." The prevailing philosophy at the time was that government was analogous to family, in that it was natural that certain people had more power than others. Locke argued that when a human is born, they are naturally free and equal to all other humans, subject only to God. Humans had a divinely ordained duty to carry out the laws of nature, such as by punishing those who break that law. However, granting that power to any particular person would only lead to anarchy and injustice. To remedy this, humans will enter an implicit "social contract" with each other, granting consent to the government to be governed. This grants the people security in exchange for a small amount of liberty. Specifically, it was the government's duty to protect its subject's "natural rights," or ones every human was entitled to upon birth: the right to life, liberty, and property. the government ought to be divided between legislative, executive, and judicial powers. These all required the consent of the majority to function. If the government failed to protect these rights, the people were entitled to overthrow it. Locke included one's own body under "property"; no one was entitled to another's labor without permission. Additionally, anything an individual helps to create through their body is their property, as well.

The second treatise was revolutionary in changing the way people thought about government. It provided heavy inspiration for Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, in which he wrote that everyone is entitled to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" (he removed property from the list because of his condemnation of slavery). It inspired the American people to overthrow the government they believed had failed to protect their natural rights. Indeed, George Washington believed Locke to be "the greatest man who had ever lived."

Title: 1689 Boston Revolt
Description: An uprising in Boston, MA that saw the imprisonment of New England Governor Sir Edmund Andros. Andros was not popular among New Englanders, as he ignored or dissolved local elected assemblies, revoked the validity of old land grants, enforced the Navigation Acts the colonists despised, and supported the Church of England in a region where Puritanism was dominant. Furthermore, people were excited by the news of the Glorious Revolution, as the popish King James they feared had been deposed. They desired to create a revolution of their own, to get rid of Andros, who they believed to be tyrannical. On April 18, groups of militia gathered in Boston, who proceeded to march around the city and began arresting Anglicans and Andros' supporters, including the governor himself. By noon, 1500 more militiamen had entered the city and joined the rebellion. They took control of a few forts, including Fort Mary (where Andros had been captured) and Fort William on Castle Island. Andros made two escape attempts, but was caught both times and placed in solitary confinement. When the rest of New England got wind of the situation, they moved to restore their old governments, complete with representative assemblies. As a result, the Dominion of New England collapsed, and England made no move to restore it thanks to the regime change.

Furthermore, they had to reject the teachings of transubstantiation, the belief of the Roman Catholic Church that the substance offered in the sacrifice of the sacrament during the Mass become the body and blood of Christ. The law did not include nontrinitarians (those that do not believe God is composed of the Holy Trinity), as well as Roman Catholics.

Title: Leisler's Rebellion
Description: An uprising in New York led by German American merchant and militia captain Jacob Leisler. He was a Calvinist that believed King James II of England was trying to force popery on the colonies. It began on May 31, when the local militia rebelled against Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson after learning of a (probably false) rumor that he planned to burn down a city. The militia, led by Leisler, captured Fort James, which contained a powder magazine they believed was important for defending the colony from Native American raids. By extension, they controlled the harbor, meaning they could circumvent Nicholson's authority concerning ships. They demanded the Nicholson be replaced by a better governor. Nicholson left for England on June 6, granting Leisler effective control over the New York government. He cleared the government of Nicholson's men and appointed his own, collecting taxes and customs duties.

On the eve of 1691, King William III of England commissioned Henry Sloughter to be governor, along with his lieutenant Major Richard Ingoldesby. The lieutenant governor demanded Leisler stand down, but he did not have the papers with him to prove that Sloughter was the new legitimate governor. Skirmishes broke out between the two groups for six weeks. Leisler eventually surrendered, and was subsequently charged with treason along with ten of his followers. Leisler and his son-in-law Jacob Milborne were hanged on May 16.

Pro-Leisler and anti-Leisler factions would continue to divide he province for some time. Though it is often depicted as Dutch settlers that desired to remove English power from the former Dutch colony, the rebellion was more similar to many other rebellions of the time, including 1676's Bacon's Rebellion in Virginia, 1677's Culpeper's Rebellion in North Carolina, 1683's Gove's Rebellion in New Hampshire, 1689's Boston revolt, and 1689's Maryland Uprising in that the rebels were all middle-class merchants or planters discontented with the elite's tight grip on the government that the former felt they had little de facto say in.

Title: Maryland Uprising
Description: A rebellion of Puritans spurred by the Glorious Revolution overthrew the colony's proprietary government. Protestants feared that the new King James II was too pro-Catholic, and began to arm themselves to take over the colony. In 1689, encouraged by the new pro-Protestant King William III, Colonel John Coode led several hundred Puritans against Catholic planter Colonel Henry Darnell, forcing him to surrender. Coode established a new government banning Catholicism and from Catholics holding office.

Title: English Bill of Rights
Description: An act signed by King William III and Queen Mary II of England. It enumerated James II's many transgressions against the people of England, reprimanding him for acting without the consent of Parliament. It confirmed that William and Mary were the new rightful rulers of the Kingdom of England. Most importantly, it contained thirteen articles that outlined freedoms of the kingdom's subjects, including:
-monarchs cannot suspend or execute laws without Parliament's consent
-monarchs cannot ignore or execute the law the way that James did
-the commission that created the Court of Commissioners for Ecclesiastical Causes is illegal, as is all similar commissions and courts
-freedom from royal taxation without Parliament's consent
-subjects may petition monarchs, and the monarchs may not prosecute them for it
-a standing army may not be kept in the kingdom during peacetime without the consent of Parliament
-Protestants have the right to bear arms for the right to self-defense
-free elections for members of Parliament (MPs)
-freedom of speech in Parliament
-no excessive bail or fines, as well as cruel and unusual punishment
-jurors must be properly chosen
-no promises of "fines and forfeitures" for particular people before conviction
-Parliament shall be held frequently to address citizens' concerns and for "amending, strengthening, and preserving of the laws"

These enumerated what were believed to be the fundamental rights for all (Protestant) Englishmen. Many of these rights, like protection against cruel and unusual punishment, would be made into US laws a century later.

Title: Virginia bans interracial marriage
Description: The Virginia General Assembly outlawed interracial marriage. Before this, only three such unions occurred in the colony, one of them being the famous marriage between John Rolfe and Pocahontas. The law was an attempt to drive a wedge between whites and blacks. After Bacon's Rebellion, states began switching to race-based chattel slavery as their main means of labor. In order to justify this system, authorities needed to dehumanize blacks to prevent sympathy towards them, which could undo the labor system that the colonies were based around. Hence, outlawing interracial marriage helped to separate the two races from each other.

Title: Salem Witch Trials
Description: A series of accusations against supposed witches in Salem, MA. It started when three girls began behaving strangely, which the town's religious leaders took to be the result of witchcraft. The girls' family slave was accused, and the only way she could get out of being hanged was to confess and name other 'witches.' This cultivated accusations against others, with many being used to settle old scores with each other. By the end of the ordeal, over 200 people (mostly women) had been accused of and confessed to being witches, even though they had done nothing wrong in reality. Eventually, the original three girls admitted they had made up the story for fun, but Salem's religious leaders refused to back down, claiming that the accused must be guilty because of their confessions. Fourteen women and five men were hanged, and five died in jail. Additionally, one man who refused to say if he was guilty or not was sentenced to be pressed to death with stones. However, despite popular legend, there were none burned at the stake. Massachusetts Governor Sir William Phips realized the flaws in the colony's judicial system, and ordered everyone accused of witchcraft to be released. At the same time, Puritan minister Cotton Mather released a document, Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits, instructed the people not to take such accusations or confessions seriously. The witchcraft epidemic dissipated soon after.

Description: After New Netherland was captured by England in 1664, Delaware had remained part of Maryland. When Pennsylvania was chartered in 1681, William Penn was granted Delaware as well. However, the Pennsylvanians and Delawareans disliked each other, and in 1701 Penn decided to grant the latter their own representative assembly, though they were still controlled by the same governor. The two colonies would continue in this relationship until 1776, when it declared independence from Great Britain.

Title: Queen Anne's War
Description: A war fought mainly between England and France over control of North America. It is often viewed as the North American theater for the War of Spanish Succession in Europe. It is known as the second the French and Indian Wars. The conflict started in Europe in 1701, when Spanish King Charles II died, causing issues over his successor. King Philip was set to assume the throne, but was also in line for the French throne, and the other powerful European nations were afraid of such a powerful union. So in early 1702, English King William III threw his support behind the Hapsburg family of the Holy Roman Empire as the true heirs to the throne. In March, King William III died as was succeeded by Queen Anne. In May, Queen Anne declared war on France and Spain, and allied her country with the Netherlands, Portugal, Prussia, Savoy, and the Holy Roman Empire. In North America, the main fighting was in New England and Quebec. The colonists were left unsupported by the English military, and were mostly outmatched by the French. However, the English did enjoy several successes, such as the defense of Charleston, SC in 1706 and the capture of St. Augustine in Spanish Florida. After several failed attacks on French Canada, such as at Fort Royal in 1704, the British finally sent troops and supplies to the colonies by 1710. With their support, the British captured the French province of Acadia. In 1711, nearly 1000 Englishmen were lost via shipwrecks above Anticost. Despite this, the English began to gain more momentum, and by 1713 the war had ended with the Peace of Utrecht, resulting in significant gains for the English.

Title: Tuscarora War
Description: A war between the British, Dutch, and German settlers of North Carolina and the Southern Tuscarora tribe. 

The Southern Tuscarora, led by Chief Hancock, launched a series of assaults along with Pamplico, Cothechney, Coree, Mattamuskeet, and Machapunga against the Europeans as revenge for encroachment, disease, and selling the Tuscarora into slavery. On September 22, they attacked and killed hundreds of colonial settlers. In response, along with assistance from South Carolina, Governor Edward Hyde put together a force of 528 men commanded by Colonel John Barnwell. His force was mostly composed of Native Americans, such as Captain Jack, a commander in Barnwell's force, along with Major Mackay and Captain William Bull. They attacked the Tuscarora on January 29, 1712 at their forts. He then marched to Fort Hancock, the main Tuscarora base, reaching it on March 1. By that time, many Native Americans in Barnwell's force had died or left to sell their new Tuscarora captives into slavery. Meanwhile, new European reinforcements from elsewhere in North Carolina, pushing the ratio of Europeans to Native Americans in his party up. He laid siege to Fort Hancock, but negotiated a peace treaty with the tribe due to his force's waning numbers and strength, as well as the fact that the Tuscarora had began torturing their captives.

For the North Carolinians, this was unacceptable. They persuaded Chief Tom Blount, chief of the neutral Northern Tuscarora, to take out Hancock. He did so, and Hancock was executed later that year. Barnwell was recalled and replaced by James Moore, who also mostly commanded Native Americans (over 900), including Yamasee and Cherokee. Moore's men killed or captured 950 Tuscarora, causing the rest to flee to New York.

The Tuscarora signed a treaty with the North Carolinians in June 1718, giving them land (that they already occupied) by the Roanoke River. The remaining Southern Tuscarora were forcefully relocated to the area. In 1722, the Tuscarora leader proclaimed everyone still in the South was to no longer be considered part of the tribe. Meanwhile, North Carolina chartered the designated Tuscarora land as Bertie County, and gradually began eroding it with speculators.

It is estimated to be the deadliest war in North Carolina's history as a colony.

Title: Province of Carolina partitioned
Description: The Province of Carolina was divided into two separate colonies. The division began in 1669, when the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina were passed. This divided Carolina into two provinces, Albemarle in the north and Clarendon in the south. The divide continued in 1691, when separate governors were appointed to each province. In 1712, the division became official; Carolina was split into North and South Carolina. However, the two colonies continued to be ruled under the Lords Proprietors until 1719, when a rebellion prompted Great Britain to appoint a royal governor instead.

Title: NYC Slave Revolt of 1712
Description: A slave uprising in New York City, NY. When New Netherland was captured by the English in 1664, they tightened restrictions on slaves' rights. However, in New York City, slaves were not only numerous (being around 1/5 of the city's total population), but also lived close by each other, allowing for easier communication to conspire against their masters. On the night of April 6, around 20 slaves set fire to a building and attacked the white colonists who tried to put it out. The rebellion was soon put down, with the militia capturing and jailing seventy blacks. 27 were put on trial, with 21 convicted and executed. 20 were burned at the stake and one was killed with a Catherine wheel, a punishment illegal to administer to whites at the time. An additional six committed suicide while in jail. The New York government proceeded to restrict slave rights even further. Slaves could not gather in groups of more than three, carry firearms, or gamble. Slaves convicted of rape, property damage, and conspiracy to kill could be executed. Slave owners desiring to free their slaves would now have to pay a substantial fee. Overall, slaves ended up in a worse situation after the rebellion than before.

Title: Treaty of Utrecht
Description: A treaty between the belligerents of Queen Anne's War that ended said conflict. It recognized King Philip V as the King of Spain, but forced him to renounce his claims to the French throne, ensuring that Spain and France would not unify. Furthermore, Spain ceded Gibraltar to Great Britain and Sicily to Savoy. France ceded Newfoundland, Rupert's Land, and Nova Scotia to Great Britain. Most importantly, Great Britain was granted a monopoly over the asiento, the slave trade between Africa and Spanish America, from the Dutch. This allowed Great Britain to become the largest commercial power in Europe.

Title: Yamasee War
Description: A large conflict between South Carolinians and a variety of Native American tribes, including but not limited to the Yamasee, Ochese Creeks, Catawba, Cherokee, Waxhaw, and Santee. 

The war stemmed from several conflicts. One of these was the aftermath of the Tuscarora War, in which North Carolinians received support from several Native American tribes (indeed, those tribes made up most of the Carolinian fighting force). This brought the initially disunified tribes closer together. One such tribe was the Yamasee, who were allied with the British, profiting off of trade with them. However, the British demand for Native American slaves and deerskin began to outpace the demand by 1715. leaving the Yamasee concerned that they themselves would be enslaved next. The tribes quickly amassed debt with the British, who they had come to rely on for supplies, as most of the available land in Carolina had been bought out by the island nation. Similar sentiments arose in the Ochese (Lower) Creeks.

After learning of a plot by the Ochese Creeks to attack, the South Carolinian government sent representative to the Yamasee for assistance. The tribe decided instead to attack the South Carolinians, slaughtering them in their sleep in an event known as the Pocotaligo Massacre. They then attacked St. Bartholomew's Parish, killing over one hundred people, as well as destroying plantations and taking prisoners. The South Carolinian militia numbering at about 250 engaged an equally sized Yamasee force. Alexander McKay followed by 100 men headed south towards a fortified encampment of Yamasee, ambushing and inflicting heavy casualties upon them. Meanwhile, British traders also suffered at the hands of the Yamasee, with 90% of the ones in the colonies when the war broke out being killed in the first few weeks.

The Catawba joined in the war soon after it started, killing Carolinian (but not Virginian) traders. On May 17, 26 out of 90 cavalry were killed by a ambush of Catawba, Wateree, and Sarraw warriors. The tribes then attacked and killed 19 out of the 30 defenders of a fort on Benjamin Schenkingh's plantation after claiming to desire peace talks. On June 13, 70 militiamen led by George Chicken ambushed the Catawba warriors. The tribe decided after that to make peace, and even militarily assist the colonists.

Unfortunately for South Carolina, the militia was starting to collapse, with many members deserting, even leaving the colony altogether. Instead, South Carolina Governor Charles Craven put together a professional paid army of nearly 1500, made of South Carolinians, Virginians, Native Americans, North Carolinians, and slaves. This was to combat the Ochese Creeks, a powerful Native American tribe waging war with the South Carolinians from the north. In fact, they are often viewed as having instigated the war just as much as the Yamasee. The Cherokee, on the other hand, were split on the war. The Lower and Middle Cherokee (especially Caesar, a Middle Cherokee chief) were generally opposed to the South Carolinians, while the Overhill Cherokee (who lived farthest away from South Carolina) wanted an alliance with the settlers. On January 27, 1716, South Carolinians found that a group of Cherokee had killed a dozen Creek at Tugaloo, claiming it was a war party. This forced an alliance between the South Carolinians and the Cherokee, and consequently a war between the Cherokee and Creek. This alliance was critical in the defense of the colonists, as even the large army Craven had organized was failing to protect the settlers from raids. By late 1717, the war was mostly over, though a few Native American tribes remained hostile towards the South Carolinians.

The colonists began to blame the Lords Proprietors, the owners of Carolina, for mismanaging the war. They called for the colonies to receive royal charters, which they did in 729. The withdrawal of the Yamasee from the area also allowed the colony of Georgia to be founded. The Yamasee was completely devastated by the war, with 25% left dead or enslaved, and the rest joined other tribes. The Catawba took over as the most powerful tribe in the region, even establishing an alliance with South Carolina.

They were originally published as "Essays on Liberty, Civil, and Religious" in the London Journal, and criticized the British government for being corrupt, immoral, and tyrannical. The essays had little effect on the British public, but were received much more passionately in the colonies, where they helped to influence American opinions against the British government.

Title: Father Rale's War
Description: A war between the New England colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy. Since the Treaty of Utrecht had not been signed by the Wabanaki, the land ceded was still recognized by them as under their control. As the British began to settle into their land, the Wabanaki pushed back. After negotiations were refused by the settlers, several raids were conducted by the Wabanaki on British settlements. After the capital of Annapolis Royal was besieged, the colonists declared war. Wabanaki led by Gray Lock made successful attacks in western Massachusetts,The rest of 1722 involved a successful defense put up by the British in New England, but were unable to launch a successful counterattack. Meanwhile, in Nova Scotia, colonists killed 25 Native Americans at the Battle of Winnepang, while losing only two themselves. A few months into 1723, the Wabanaki conducted over a dozen raids in and around Maine. In 1724, a British offensive of about 20 were destroyed by Wabanaki warriors, who spared only their Native American guides. In retaliation, the British attacked a large Wabanaki village called Norridgewock, killing a local chief, Native American leader and secret Canadian agent Father Rale, as well as a couple dozen others. British Captain John Lovewall conducted a few raids against the Wabanaki in the winter of 1724-1725, with the third against the Pequawket warriors, in which the British attack force was compromised, though they killed Pequawket Chief Paugus. Despite French protest, the Penobscot Native Americans asked for peace, who succeeded in getting most of the Wabanaki to do the same (except for Gray Lock, who would continue until 1727). Consequentially, British hold around Maine tightened, and no major war would occur in the region for about 30 years.

Title: <i>Pennsylvania Gazette</i>
Description: The Pennsylvania Gazette, a newspaper, was purchased by Benjamin Franklin and Hugh Meredith on October 2, 1729. It was originally created in 1728 by Samuel Kreimer, who had different intentions for the paper. Kreimer planned to print out a page of Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences in each copy. When Franklin bought the paper, he scratched the cyclopedia idea. The Gazette quickly became the most successful newspaper in the colonies, reaching 2000 subscribers at its peak. Franklin frequently wrote articles for the Gazette anonymously, such as in 1752 when he published the results of his kite-flying experiment. The newspaper also published America's first political cartoon, the famous "Join, or Die" snake in 1754. The newspaper was discontinued in 1800, ten years after Franklin died.

Title: First Great Awakening
Description: A resurgence of extreme religious enthusiasm, stretching from the 1730s to 1760s. It was a response to the declining religious enthusiasm in New England, and mainly appealed to the uneducated. Evangelicals, most prominently Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, delivered sermons convincing people to become more religious. Edwards, a Puritan minister from Massachusetts, described God as a wrathful deity who threatened to cast all of humanity into the depths of Hell, and the only way for people to save themselves would be to immediately plead forgiveness for all of their sins and accept Christ into their life. Similarly, Whitefield contradicted the Puritan notion that everyone was either saved or doomed from the moment of birth, instead arguing that God would show mercy if people would only repent of their sins. Preachers condemned those who seeked to use religion to turn a profit. causing people to start questioning religious authority. This challenging of authority would resurge in the 1760s and 1770s, when colonists began doubting the word of British political figures, instead trusting what they themselves believed. Some preachers slavery or even freed their slaves, declaring that blacks and whites were brothers. Some blacks and women began preaching, as well, making the movement important in racial and gender equality.

Title: Province of Georgia founded
Description: The Province of Georgia (named after King George II of England) was charted to General James Oglethorpe, a wealthy Brit who desired to create a safe haven for those who had been imprisoned for debt. The British government also supported the creation of the colony because they wanted a buffer between South Carolina, one of the most lucrative continental British American colonies due to its rice cultivation, and Spanish Florida. However, once the colonists started arriving, they became discontented with the strict laws enforced by Oglethorpe. He banned both liquor and slavery, both of which the colonists desired. In an attempt to placate them, Oglethorpe granted the colonists the power of self-government, which they used to legalize slavery in 1751, along with establishing an elected assembly. Georgia would later go on to become a royal colony in 1752.

Title: Zenger libel trial
Description: John Peter Zenger was a journalist for the New-York Weekly Journal in New York City, NY. In 1733, Zenger criticized New York Governor William Cosby for meddling in the colony's Supreme Court in an attempt to control it. This angered Cosby, who had Zenger arrested for libel (slander). Zenger was defended by Andrew Hamilton and William Smith, who argued that if an accusation was true, it could not be libel. The jury determined Zenger to be not guilty after just ten minutes of deliberation. This was a huge win for the press, as well as the people, who had taken a passionate interest in the trial. The case set the groundwork for the freedom of the press, which would later become a dearly held value of the US.

Title: Walking Purchase
Description: A land deal between Pennsylvania colonists and the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. The Lenape agreed to give up land bounded by the distance that a man could walk in 36 hours. Provincial secretary James Logan procured an incorrectly drawn map mislabeling two rivers. That way, it would appear that Logan's team of walkers could travel much farther than they actually did. Additionally, Logan hired the three fastest runners in the colony - Edward Marshall, Solomon Jennings, and James Yeates - to complete the circuit. Marshall made it seventy miles away, putting the total area captured at 1.2 million acres. Upset, the Lenape appealed to the Iroquois, who decided not to intervene.

Title: Stono Rebellion
Description: The largest slave rebellion to take place in the British mainland colonies. It was led by literate slave Jemmy (aka Cato), who led a group of around 80 armed slaves to Spanish Florida, where the government promised freedom. They started off at the Stono River at the South Carolina Colony, where they attacked several whites before being subdued and captured by local militia groups. A group of rebels escaped and skirmished with militias again before their re-capture. Each rebel was then either executed or shipped to the West Indies.

Title: War of Jenkins' Ear
Description: A war between Great Britain and Spain started so that the former could establish economic dominance. The war's name stemmed from an incident in 1731 in which British merchant Captain Robert Jenkins had his ear cut off by Spaniards. Hoping to keep their monopoly on the slave trade, as well as dominating Caribbean trade, Great Britain used the attack to justify a war that they hoped would remove Spanish presence from the New World. 

The British declared war and launched an attack on Venezuela in the Battle of La Guaira, but were defeated. The British then captured the town of Portabelo, Panama, wrecking its forts and warehouses. The victory was celebrated wholeheartedly in Great Britain. In March through May 1740, British Vice Admiral Edward Vernon launched three attacks on the Spanish town of Cartagena de Indias, with the first two failing to do more than scout Spanish defenses. The third was the climax of the war, with the British launching a massive attack, composed of 186 ships bearing 27,000 troops. Vernon and his forces surrounded the city, but were impeded by Spanish trenches around the city's walls and were hit hard by Spanish forces led by Spanish Admiral Blas de Lezo. With yellow fever rampant in his troops, Vernon was forced to retreat to Jamaica, his forces suffering 6000 to Lezo's 1000. 

Vernon continued on, destroying a fort in San Lorenzo el Real Chagres, attacking Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and Panama City. Meanwhile, British Georgians besieged St. Augustine, Florida, to no effect. Florida and Georgia proceeded to attack each other for a few years. Vernon attacked La Guaira again in 1743, but was repelled. This was the last major action of the war, as by 1742 most British force were diverted to Europe to fight the War of Austrian Succession. Both wars were resolved in 1848 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

Title: "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" speech
Description: A famous speech given by evangelical Jonathan Edwards in Enfield, CT. He conjured up frightful images of God, insisting that the Lord could at any moment cast anyone he wished into the depths of Hell. He claimed that 'the wicked' would suffer endlessly at the hands of Satan, and were already experiencing some of that Hell on Earth. The only way anyone could save themselves would be to openly accept Christ and recant all of their sins. This inspired many in the audience to immediately follow Edwards' advice and plead for forgiveness. The sermon was highly influential for converting people.

Title: King George's War
Description: A war between two alliances of a European power and a Native American Confederacy: Great Britain and the Iroquois Confederacy, and France and the Wabanaki Confederacy. These were the same belligerents as in Queen Anne's War. In Europe, Great Britain had allied themselves with Austria in the War of Austrian Succession, thereby making themselves opponents of France and Prussia. The French attacked Canso (a British fishing port), and Annapolis Royal, the then-capital of Acadia. In August, the French-Wabanaki alliance attacked Fort Anne in Annapolis Royal, but were unable to penetrate its defenses. British colonists captured Fortress Louisbourg in a six-week siege in 1745. France attempted to recover the fort the next year, but was defeated by weather and disease. There was a lot of raiding, mostly by the French-Wabanaki alliance. The same alliance destroyed the town of Saratoga, NY, and forced the residents around the area to evacuate. The war ended in 1748 with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, though the treaty did nothing to resolve hostilities between the nations.

France and Great Britain were upset that they had to relinquish the lands they took (the Austrian Netherlands and Louisbourg, respectively). Italy, however, became stable, while Spain got to retain control of all their colonies. Great Britain did not get the control over the New World they were hoping for.

Description: The Ohio Company, a land speculating company, was granted half a million acres of the Ohio River Valley by the Virginian government. The company consisted of the richest and most powerful in Virginia, including the colony's royal governor, Robert Dinwiddie. This pressured other groups that had their eyes on the land, such as Native American groups, Pennsylvanian speculators, and the French. Great Britain's European rival stepped up their control over the Ohio River Valley, creating tensions between the two countries, which would soon erupt into the French and Indian War.

Title: Battle of Jumonville Glen
Description: The first conflict of the French and Indian War. Lieutenant Colonel George Washington and Mingo Chief Tanacharison led a band of 40 Virginian militia and 15 Mingo warriors to a scouting party of 35 French Canadiens, planning to attack them. The party was led by French officer Joseph Coulon de Villiers de Jumonville, who were patrolling the area to see if Washington would enter French territory. When the two groups found each other,they battled for about 15 minutes. Tanacharison split Jumonville's head open with a tomahawk, with the defeat of the rest of the Canadiens soon after. Washington and his men then constructed Fort Necessity nearby.

Title: Albany Conference
Description: The Albany Conference, or Albany Congress, was a meeting of delegates from several Northern British colonies in Albany, NY to discuss plans of union for the purposes of defense against the French and Indians. All of New England (Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire) attended, as well as the Middle Colonies of Pennsylvania and New York. Invitations were sent to the other colonies, but they declined to attend, claiming the threat of the French was a Northern issue and did not concern them. The conference attempted to enforce the alliance with the Iroquois Confederacy, which had been faltering since the outbreak of the French and Indian War several months prior to the conference, but the 150 tribal representatives withdrew from the meeting early on without agreement to help the British.

Nevertheless, the conference continued, deliberating over regulations of Indian affairs and westward migration. What was not planned was what soon became the main topic of discussion. Pennsylvania delegate Benjamin Franklin introduced his Plan of Union, a confederation of the British North American colonies. It was to be a government composed of a royally appointed President General and a Grand Council of delegates nominated by the lower houses of the colonial legislatures. Each colony would elect between two and seven delegates proportional to population, though each colony would only get one vote in every matter. The confederation would have some authority to levy taxes, make treaties, and raise an army for the common defense of the colonies. In order to communicate the danger posed by France, Franklin drew his now-famous "Join, or Die" snake cartoon.

The plan was approved by the delegates, but had to be agreed upon by the Crown and colonial assemblies, both of whom rejected it. The British government was cautious of giving further power to the colonies, who in their eyes, had already been given considerable self-determination. The colonial assemblies opposed the plan because in their eyes, the British government already controlled them to a considerable degree, and did not want to give up further power to another government. The plan was further unpopular among the colonists, who felt that both the colonial and British governments interfered with their daily affairs too much, and did not want to be further micromanaged by a third level of government. Though Franklin’s plan failed, it was significant in that it was the first proposal to unite the Thirteen Colonies, and provided inspiration for the Articles of Confederation over 20 years later.

Title: Battle of Fort Necessity
Description: The first large-scale conflict of the French and Indian War, fought between around 300 South Carolinian and Virginian regulars and officers led by Lt. Colonel George Washington and Captain James Mackay and 600 French regulars and Canadien militia and 100 Native American warriors led by Louis Coulon de Villiers.

After the battle of Jumonville Glen, Washington, Tanacharison and their men constructed Fort Necessity at Great Meadows in Pennsylvania, finishing by June 3. Coulon, seeking vengeance for the death of his brother at the Jumonville Glen, found the fort the next month. Coulon's men charged at Washington's line, at which the Virginians promptly ran back into the fort. Unable to inflict meaningful casualties on the French, who had taken cover in the woods nearby, Washington agreed to Coulon's terms of surrender, abandoning the fort.

Title: Battle of Braddock's Field
Description: A conflict in the French and Indian War between 1300 British troops led by Major General Edward Braddock and an alliance of 108 French troops, 146 French militiamen, and 637 Native American warriors led by Captain Daniel Liénard de Beaujeu. Beaujeu was killed quickly in the engagement, but the rest of the men continued fighting. The warriors used psychological warfare against the British, shrieking while fighting them and nailing the dead's scalps to trees. The British units soon fell into disarray, but Braddock refused to retreat. After about three hours of fighting, he was fatally wounded, spurring the British to retreat.

Title: Siege of Louisbourg
Description: A nearly two-month siege of the French-controlled Fortress of Louisbourg by the British. After a few weeks of bad weather, Major General James Wolfe captured Lighthouse Point near Louisbourg on June 12. The British artillery then began bombarding the fort. On July 23, a cannonball set fire to the King's Bastion, the largest building in North America and the headquarters of the fort, damaging French morale. Three days later, British Admiral Edward Boscawen sent in a naval force that disabled the last of the French ships. The French surrendered and were forced to give up their arms and flags. The position of the fort allowed the British to more easily attack Quebec.

Title: Battle of Carillon
Description: A battle of the French and Indian War between the British and French, both of whom had colonist militia, troops, and Native American warriors on each side. The British, led by General James Abercrombie, had forces far superior to the French, sporting 12,000 men to General Marquis de Montcalm's 3600. Despite this, Abercrombie made several key misjudgments that led to a French victory. Specifically, he decided to attempt a direct assault on the strategically located French Fort Carillon with no artillery, despite their enemies being well entrenched. When this failed, he tried the charge several more times. Montcalm rallied his men, trying to keep their spirit up in the face of superior numbers. After extensive casualties, Abercrombie gave up and retreated. It was the deadliest conflict in the French and Indian War.

Casualties:
100 French/Canadiens/Native Americans killed

Description: A battle in the French and Indian War in which 750 British men led by Major James Grant attacked French Fort Duquesne in modern-day Pittsburgh, PA.

The Indians were well-adapted to fighting in the forest, using the trees as cover from British bullets. Grant and Major Andrew Lewis were both captured, leading the rest of the British to retreat. However, the French knew that a much larger attack was coming, so they remained in the fort until November 26, when they burned it down.

Title: Treaty of Paris (1763)
Description: The 1763 Treaty of Paris was an agreement between Great Britain, Portugal, Spain, and France that ended the Seven Years' War and the French and Indian War. France ceded nearly all of its land in North America to Great Britain. This included Canada and the eastern half of French Louisiana, the latter being the region east of the Mississippi River and west of the Appalachian Mountains. For their part, Spain gave up East Florida to Great Britain. France also gave up control of Dominica, Grenada, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Tobago, all lucrative sugar islands, to Great Britain. In return, France remained in control of western Louisiana and the island of Guadeloupe. This sugar colony produced 6 million pounds a year, while Canada made comparatively less and was more expensive to maintain, so France saw this as a favorable loss. Voltaire once quipped that Canada was nothing more than "a few acres of snow". The French Canadians, on the other hand, were outraged at the French concession and their home country's indifferent attitude towards their plight.

The French Canadians were Catholic, which the British were apprehensive about governing. However, they moreso feared aggravating tensions with France by deporting or forcibly converting the Canadians, as well as the possibility that those deported would escape to and strengthen other French American colonies, so for the time being the British left them be. France was of course upset at their loss, but saw the treaty as quite favorable due to their retention of their Carribbean sugar islands and the loss of the expensive Canada. They hoped that the Americans would rebel against the British, a wish that would come true 25 years later.

The treaty also stipulated that Great Britain was to allow Catholicism to be freely practiced in Canada, and grant free emigration from Canada for 18 months, though only 270 French Canadians ended up leaving in that time. The treaty specified different treatment of Quebec from the rest of Canada, which was the beginning of that region's semi-independent culture and government that persists to this day.

This treaty put Great Britain in control of much of North America, and the end of French influence in the region. Canada and the region east of the Mississippi would continue to be dominated by British law, culture, and people. The end of the war also solidified Great Britain's status as the most powerful nation in Europe, though their newly acquired severe debt somewhat tempered their victory. As a more immediate consequence, Americans from the Thirteen colonies began moving west of the Appalachian Mountains to explore and settle in the newly acquired lands, which brought them into conflict with the Indian tribes in the region.

Title: <b>Pontiac's Rebellion</b>
Description: Native American raids continued on British colonies. Spurred by the scalpings of innocent settlers, the British military in 1764, set out for revenge in a series of harsh punitive expeditions, devastating the tribes. The war was resolved between Pontiac and Sir William Johnson at New York in 1766.

Pontiac's Rebellion was a war between British colonists and troops and a confederacy of American Indian tribes led by the Odawa chief Pontiac around the eastern Great Lakes region.

The war immediately followed and was directly caused by the end of the French and Indian War. Great Britain defeated France and gained recognition of nearly all of the eastern portion of North America, and prepared to settle colonists in the new region. Most of the Indians living there had preferred the relatively positive relationships they shared with the French, and were upset to learn that they would only be seeing the British, who tended to treat them significantly worse. Not only did colonists come in droves, but the military followed, intending to secure a newly won region but tensing the situation further. General Jeffrey Amherst, the British commander-in-chief in North America, further deteriorated their relationship in February 1761 by ending the policy of gift-giving. The Indians had seen the many gifts given by the French as fair payment for use of what they considered their land, but Amherst saw this as unnecessary bribery, and was pressured by Great Britain's lack of finances to end such an expensive policy. Amherst also limited the amount of gunpowder traders could sell to Indians. Several years prior the Cherokee had fought against the British, but gave up due to a lack of gunpowder, and Amherst hoped that limiting the resource would discourage any future uprisings. The Indians objected, claiming that gunpowder was necessary for food to eat and fur to trade.

This tension erupted on April 28, 1763, when Odawa chief Pontiac convinced several hundred Indians from various tribes to attack the British-controlled Fort Detroit near where there would later be a city of the same name. Pontiac besieged the fort for several months, defeating a surprise attack by British reinforcements at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31. Meanwhile, Indians elsewhere attacked other British forts in the region, successfully capturing eight: Forts Sandusky, St. Joseph, Miami, Ouiatenonin, Michilimackinac, Venango, Le Boeuf, and Presque, the last falling on June 21. The British garrisons were often lured out of the forts under false pretenses before being killed.

Fearing for their safety, settlers in western Pennsylvania sought refuge in Fort Pitt, which Pontiac's confederacy advanced on and besieged. Becoming increasingly desperate, the officers in Fort Pitt gave to the besieging Delaware Indians blankets previously used by people infected with smallpox in hopes of the disease spreading among their attackers. It is unsure how effective this strategy was, but in terms of the total number of Indian deaths from smallpox it was a small factor.

Colonel Henry Bouquet was dispatched with 500 troops to assist Fort Pitt. On August 1, most of the besieging Indians left the fort and marched to meet his force. They fought on August 5 at the Battle of Bushy Run, where Bouquet narrowly defeated the force, and on August 20 rescued Fort Pitt. This victory would not last long, as on September 14 several hundred Indians attacked a supply train near Fort Niagara, killing more than 70, which the British dubbed the Devil's Hole Massacre.

The early success of Pontiac's confederacy prompted a group of western Pennsylvanians to form a vigilante group called the Paxton Boys to attack Indians living in the region. On December 14, the Paxton Boys killed six Susquehannocks living peacefully in the village of Conestoga, and another 14 that were placed in protective custody in Lancaster. In January the next year, several hundred Paxton Boys marched on Philadelphia, but were eventually dispersed by the presence of British troops, local militia, and negotiations with Benjamin Franklin. 

Indian raids on British villages continued well into 1764. Amherst, deemed responsible for the rebellion, was recalled and replaced with Major General Thomas Gage, who ordered two punitive expeditions, one by Bouquet and the other by Colonel John Bradstreet. Meanwhile, Sir William Johnson, British superintendant of the Indian Department, negotiated a treaty at Fort Niagara. Bradstreet did the same at Fort Detroit, against his superior's wishes. By the time Bouquet arrived at the villages he was targeting most of their inhabitants were ready to make peace.

While the war was mostly over by this point, Great Britain had resolved to make peace with all the Indians in the region. Gage sent Pontiac a wampum belt, an essential tool in peace talks with the Indians from that region. Pontiac himself had lessened his aggression after hearing of the treaties the British had made. A final treaty with Pontiac was formalized on July 25, 1766, as a kind of stalemate, the British not being able to conquer the land, but the Indians not being able to drive out the British.

Pontiac's Rebellion marked a sharp decline in British-Indian relations, with both sides in the war determined to drive the other out completely. Convinced that Brits and Indians could not live side-by-side, and fearing that defending colonists from Indian attacks like Pontiac's would be too expensive for an empire in deep financial straits, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, declaring that all land west of the Appalachian Mountains would be Indian territory, and the colonists were not to settle there. The war also demonstrated the success Indians could see when forming a confederacy. Indians would fight many a war with colonists in the future, and they would see the greatest success when forming a confederacy like Pontiac's.

Title: Siege of Fort Detroit
Description: The SIege of Fort Detroit was the opening conflict in Pontiac's Rebellion. On May 7, Pontiac and a force of 300 men approached the fort, having captured and killed a small British surveying party the day before. Pontiac's plan was to be invited into the fort under the pretense of diplomacy and take the fort by surprise with concealed weapons. However, Henry Gladwin, the British commander in charge of Fort Detroit, was apparently already aware of this plan, and refused to let the Confederates in. Pontiac tried once again to trick Gladwin into letting his men in two days later, but this, too, failed. Instead, Pontiac laid siege to the fort, as well as killing a number of British settlers in the area, one of which was ritually cannabalized. Shortly after the siege started, Pontiac requested a peace talk with two British officers at a neutral location, whom he immediately took hostage.

Title: Siege of Fort Pitt
Description: An infamous battle of Pontiac's Rebellion. Delaware Native American warriors had surrounded Fort Pitt, demanding that they receive the land that had been stolen from them. The colonists refused, claiming that it was now their home. In response, the Delaware laid siege to the fort. Commander-in-Chief, North America Jeffery Amherst was infuriated by this turn of events, who had previously not thought of the Native Americans to be any threat. He sent a large force to defend the fort, but were intercepted by more Native American warriors and defeated. Running out of options and becoming ever angrier, Amherst demanded the colonists use any means necessary to "Extirpate this Execrable Race," including the intentional infection of smallpox. Though the concept of germs had not been developed yet, they understood that people could become infected by the same disease if they came into contact with something a previous victim had touched. Thus, on June 24 the colonists 'gifted' the Delaware with two blankets received from a smallpox hospital. They had the desired effect; the disease quickly spread not only throughout the Delaware, but to nearby Shawnee villages as well. Despite the fact that Native American populations was fairly spread out over the continent, smallpox was infectious enough to have a large impact. Historians suspect this intentional infection occurred more frequently, but were not documented because of the seriousness of the act.

Title: Royal Proclamation of 1763
Description: The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was a declaration by King George III of Great Britain that designated British land west of the Appalachian Mountains as Indian territory, and that colonists were not to settle there. It also forbade the sale of Native American land to individuals. The proclamation was prompted by the outbreak of Pontiac's Rebellion, which threatened the safety of colonists on the frontier. Great Britain, being under a tight budget due to the financial strains the Seven Years' War placed on the empire, could not afford to station large numbers of troops on the frontier to protect the colonists from attacks like Pontiac's. 

This had the opposite effect of the king's intentions; colonists were furious that they had spent nine years fighting and dying to drive the French off the continent, only to be barred from claiming the land they had just won. The line was ignored, with colonists continuing to settle west, which heightened tensions with Indians as expected. This marked the beginning in what would become a long string of defiances by the colonists against British orders.

Title: Parson's Cause
Description: In the 1750s, a drought struck Virginia, leading to an increase in tobacco prices. The price of tobacco before the droubt had been two pence per pound, and debts were often expressed in terms of pounds of tobacco. To relieve the stress placed on farmers, the House of Burgesses passed the Two Penny Act in 1758, which temporarily allowed debts measured in tobacco to be paid off at a rate of two pence per pound. A group of clergymen who held were owed debts to be paid in tobacco petitioned the London Board of Trade to repeal the law, which they did. The clergymen then sued their debtors so that they could be paid in tobacco as initially promised, a case called Parson's Cause. Patrick Henry was practicing law at the time, and was invited onto a counsel to argue in court. Henry declared the Two Penny Act veto to violate Virginians' constitutional rights, and called any king who annulled good laws such as that a "tyrant" who "forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience". Henry's speech earned him a treason accusation, but he ignored it. Though not a hugely pivotal moment in colonial history, this was an early example of hostile language used against King George III that would in years to come become commonplace.

Title: Sugar Act
Description: The Sugar Act was a tax levied by Parliament on the colonies that replaced the Molasses Act of 1733. It lowered the tax on imported molasses to North America from six pence to three, but in return strengthened the tax's enforcement. Previous taxes, such as the Navigation Acts, had been frequently ignored by the colonists, who engaged in smuggling to avoid having to pay more. Great Britain was initially able to afford the loss, as the colonies generated enough profit to be lenient on tax collecting. However, after the Seven Years' War, Great Britain had resolved to station ten thousand troops in the colonies for their protection against the French and Indians, and the colonists were expected to contribute to the troops' payment. The Sugar Act seeked to put an end to tax evasion via smuggling by strengthening the admiralty courts that charged smugglers by removing the right of the accused to a trial by jury. The tax hit New England ports hard, even more so as it came at a time of economic depression. Samuel Adams and James Otis of Massachusetts were among the strongest objectors to the tax, complaining that it violated their right to tax themselves as outlined in their colonial charter. A group of fifty Boston merchants committed to stop purchasing British luxury imports, and in New York City colonial production of goods increased. Aside from this, objection to the Sugar Act was relatively muted outside port cities like Boston, as it mainly affected merchants. It was the first in a line of taxes levied by the British government that produced tension between the colonies and the homeland.

Title: Currency Act
Description: The Currency Act of 1764 was a law passed by Parliament that prohibited residents of all thirteen colonies from using paper money to pay off any public or private debt. Parliament passed the law because they found regulating printed colonial currency difficult, preferring specie (gold or silver) to be used like back in England. Printed currency was subject to rampant inflation, especially in New England. A particularly bad example was Rhode Island, whose currency in 1740 was worth a mere four percent of its face value. Unfortunately, specie was in short supply in the colonies, and the Currency Act made it even more difficult to pay their debts. Colonists, including Benjamin Franklin, who was in London at the time, would petition Parliament for the next nine years to repeal or amend the law. It was seen as a "major grievance" and many felt as if Great Britain did not understand their struggles. They also didn't appreciate Great Britain limiting their autonomy, something they had been promised and grown used to the the last century.

In 1770, the New York legislature informed Parliament that the Currency Act was preventing them from paying for the (also unpopular) Quartering Act, which required the colonies to pay for the presence of British soldiers there. Great Britain, fearing taking on such an expensive duty themselves when they were in deep financial straits, gave in and allowed £120,000 in paper currency to be printed to pay for the soldiers. In 1773 Parliament amended the Currency Act to allow paper currency to be used for public debts, which considerably eased tensions. Nevertheless, it was an early sign for many that Great Britain did not truly understand the colonists and that their local legislatures were better suited to governing them.

Title: Pope Day riot in Boston
Description: Pope Day was an anti-Catholic holiday annually celebrated in the thirteen colonies, especially in New England. It was typically celebrated by the lower class, including sailors, laborers, apprentices, servants, and even black slaves, and was an occasion for drinking and rioting. It was most popular in Boston due to its large number of sailors. Effigies of the pope and the Devil were paraded around and burned, and the elites were insulted. The Pope Day riot in 1764 was particularly heated, as a carriage bearing one such effigy ran over a boy, killing him. Pope Day began to decline in popularity after the passage of the Stamp Act. The response to the tax united the lower, middle, and upper classes, lessening the hostility between classes expressed in Pope Day.

Title: <b>Stamp Act Crisis</b>
Description: The Stamp Act Crisis was a period of unrest in the British American colonies, particularly in Boston, Massachusetts, over the 1765 Stamp Act, a direct tax on paper. Great Britain was in sore need of money, as it had driven itself deeply in debt fighting the Seven Years' War. Parliament decided that a good source of that money would be the American colonies, as some of that money the mother country had spent had gone to protecting them from the French and Indians. The situation was excacerbated by the outbreak of Pontiac's Rebellion, which further threatened the safety of the colonists, demanding more expenses for soldiers stationed in the colonies. The Stamp Act marked the first time Great Britain directly taxed goods on its colonies rather than regulating trade. The law required that any good made from paper made in the colonies, including books, commercial papers, court documents, land deeds, newspapers, wills, etc., had to carry a stamp that would be purchased from British authorities. Unlike the Sugar Act, which mostly only affected ports, the Stamp Act affected nearly every colonist, rich or poor, but especially hurting those whose business relied on paper. This, combined with the tax's directness, was what resulted in the much larger outrage over the tax than there had been over the Sugar Act.

The main issue around the tax was the idea of "taxation without representation". Colonists could not vote in parliamentary elections, and so had no direct representation. The British Constitution guaranteed that subjects could not be taxed without their consent, which took the form of parliamentary representation. Opponents of the tax argued that this meant the tax was unconstitutional and violated their rights. Proponents of the tax countered by pointing out that three fourths of British subjects, even on the island, could not vote in parliamentary elections, either. Proponents agreed that nonconsensual taxation violated the rights of the colonists, but argued that the colonists had "virtual representation", as it was the job of Parliament to represent the interests of all British subjects. 

This was insufficient logic for the colonists, who began protesting for "no taxation without representation." Samuel Adams of Boston, who would become the tax's most virulent opponent, wrote that it violated the colonies' right to manage their own taxes, as outlined in their charters. The opposition to the tax was shared across the thirteen colonies. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Virginia had already sent protests to Parliament over the Sugar Act, and by the end of 1765 every colony except North Carolina and Georgia had sent one over the Stamp Act. The Virginia House of Burgesses published a series of resolutions formally documenting their disapproval of the tax. Nine of the thirteen colonies sent delegates to the Stamp Act Congress, to coordinate a proper response to the tax. They wrote the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, formally outlining the popular colonial position on the Stamp Act, to be sent to Parliament and the king.

Protests broke out in the streets, the largest of which came from Boston. Ebenezer MacIntosh, a local cobbler, hanged an effigy of Andrew Oliver, a local stamp distributor. He gathered a mob and together they paraded the effigy through the city, destroying Oliver's office, then beheading and burning his effigy. They then destroyed Oliver's house, and stoned Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson and Sheriff Stephen Greenleaf when they attempted to stop the mob. MacIntosh paraded Oliver himself through the streets and forced him to publicly resign. On August 26, MacIntosh decided to attack Hutchinson himself, even though the lieutenant governor privately opposed the Stamp Act. MacIntosh gathered another mob and raided Hutchinson's mansion,  evicting him and his family and destroying most of his possessions, including his documentation of much of Massachusetts' early history. Deputy Register of the Vice-Admiralty William Story and Comptroller of Customs Benjamin Hollowell were subjected to similar attacks.

Groups resisting the Stamp Act broke out across the colonies, calling themselves the Sons of Liberty. These groups allowed people to bypass the stamps, forced Stamp Act collectors to resign, and burned effigies of royal officials. The Sons of Liberty comprised mostly of the middle and upper class, but performed large public demonstrations to win the approval of the common man as well. The Sons of Liberty in each colony created committees of correspondence to coordinate with groups in other colonies. Connections were made between New York and Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island, Rhode Island and New Hampshire, and Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Sons of Liberty also formed in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. Importantly, merchants began boycotting British goods, and refusing to sell their own goods to the homeland. They hoped that Parliament would back down if their economy suffered from the tax, instead of benefiting. Though rebels, the Sons of Liberty maintained loyalty to the Crown, and would not have dreamed of full independence.

One of the would-be hardest-hit indstries were the newspapers, as of course they relied heavily on paper. They also of course had an excellent outlet for voicing their frustrations, of which they made good use. They reported effigy hangings and resignation speeches, and decried the tax as tyrannical and despotic. There were a few pro-Stamp Act papers, who criticized the violent protests, but they were few compared to the tax's opponents.

While most of the popular protests and riots came from Massachusetts, a few cropped up in other colonies, mainly in the north. In New York, anonymous threats against anyone who collected or used stamped papers were made, and Governor Cadwallader Colden's house was raided by two thousand people. In Rhode Island, a crowd headed by Sons of Liberty built a gallows and hanged effigies of local stamp distributors. The crowd turned into a mob later that night, headed by John Weber, who was not affiliated with or supported by the Sons of Liberty. The mob attacked the houses of said distributors and damaged their property. One of the distributors, Martin Howard, was the only prominent American to publicly support the Stamp Act. In Frederick, Maryland, a court of magistrates ruled the Stamp Act invalid and ordered that city residents ignore it. The next week, a mock funeral for the tax was carried out in the streets. Smaller protests broke out in New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania.

But the thirteen colonies that would later rebel were not the only British American colonies. The reactions to the tax in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the Caribbean were more subdued. The <i>Quebec Gazette</i> suspended publication until the act was repealed. Nova Scotia's stamp distributor resigned in January 1766. There were also a few scattered protests in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Barbados, Antigua, St. Kitts, Nevis, Montserrat, and Jamaica. But for the most part, the outrage was localized to what would become the United States eleven years later.

The outrage to the tax shocked Parliament. They had not expected such a coordinated response from a group of colonies who had seldom worked together and failed to unite during the 1754 Albany Convention. Ideas on how to respond were mixed, with some worrying that a repeal would set a dangerous precedent for colonists to freely defy Parliament, and others fearing the potential economic suffering of the colonies the tax would cause would be too great. Repealing the tax was debated, with William Pitt, Edmund Burke, and Prime Minister Lord Rockingham arguing in favor, and George Grenville, who had been prime minister when the Stamp Act was passed, arguing in opposition. Parliament eventually decided to repeal the tax, but pass the Declaratory Act along with it, declaring that Parliament's authority to tax the colonies was absolute. They also formally condemned the riots and required compensation for those whose property had been damaged by the mobs. The act's repeal was widely celebrated throughout the colonies, and on March 21 a liberty pole was raised to commemorate the protestors' victory.

The Stamp Act Crisis was the beginning of widespread resistance to the British government. It began the discussions on ideas of liberty and self-determination, and examination of whether those rights were respected under the current system. It was the beginning in a line of offenses that would lead the thirteen colonies to declare independence.

Title: Quartering Act 1765
Description: The Quartering Act 1765 was an attempt to resolve the problem of housing British soldiers stationed in the colonies. General Thomas Gage, commander-in-chief of the British Army in North America, struggled to pay for quartering and provisioning his troops. The colonies had paid for the troops during the French and Indian War, but refused to do so after the war ended, pointing out that there had been no British troops stationed there before the war and saw no need to keep them after. The British argued that the troops were necessary to protect the colonies from Indian raids like those conducted by Pontiac. Parliament's solution was the Quartering Act, which required colonies to house the soldiers in barracks and public houses, but if those ran out of room, they would be quartered in inns, livery stables, ale houses, victualing houses, and the houses of vendors of alcoholic beverages. If even this was not enough, the remaining soldiers would be housed in uninhabited houses, outhouses, barns, or other buildings. Furthermore, colonies had to foot the bill for the soldiers' housing and food. While the Quartering Act 1765 is often described in the modern day as having forced colonists to house the soldiers in their own private homes, this is in fact not true.

New Yorkers objected strongly to this bill, feeling the soldiers' presence as an invasion and them having to pay for it as an injustice. When 1500 troops arrived in New York City in 1766, the provincial government refused to house or pay for them. In support of the legislature, New York Sons of Liberty staged large protests in the city, especially around Fort George, where many soldiers were stationed. Parliament threatened to suspend New York's governor and legislature, causing the colony to back down and comply with the law. Outside New York, reaction to the Quartering Act was less visceral. Only Pennsylvania fully executed the law, though South Carolina also followed all provisions except providing salt and beer for the soldiers. Massachusetts, the center of the Stamp Act protests, initially tried to nullify the law, but when the British soldiers stationed in nearby Fort William declared a state of emergency, the legislature backed down and began senting supplies. Boston radicals objected, claiming the legislature was hypocritical for abiding by the Quartering Act when they protested the Stamp Act, causing the legislature to once again reverse their position. Massachusetts, along with most of the rest of New England, decided to ignore the law instead.

Title: Virginia Stamp Act Resolutions
Description: The Virginia Stamp Act Resolutions, also known as the Virginia Resolves, were a set of resolutions passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in response to the passage of the Stamp Act. They were introduced by Patrick Henry, a lawyer and representative who had gained a reputation as a firebrand during the Parson's Cause trial, in which he called King George III a tyrant. He introduced five resolutions, which consisted of the following:

1) The first settlers of Virginia brought with them the same liberties, privileges, and immunities enjoyed by all British subjects.
2) Virginia's two royal charters declared the colony's settlers to be entitled to all such liberties, privileges, and immunities.
3) Only taxation determined by the people or elected representatives can protect against "a burdensome taxation", which is one such British right.
4) This right has been respected by Great Britain ever since the foundation of Virginia.
5) Therefore, only the Virginia House of Burgesses has the right to levy taxes on the Virginian people and anyone who tries to empower another entity to do the same is an enemy of freedom.

When Henry introduced the resolutions, he gave a speech, noting "Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it". By this, he meant that the British people saw Caesar and Charles I as tyrants who were executed by defenders of liberty. By likening George III to these two, he implied that the king may face a similar fate if he continued his tyranny. His speech was not well-received among the House of Burgesses, with the Speaker accusing him of treason. Nevertheless, the House passed the first four resolutions, choosing to forgo the most radical fifth. However, when colonial newspapers reported on the resolutions, they included not only the four passed ones, but the fifth one and even two more of unknown origin. These extra two read that Virginians were not bound to obey taxation law not passed by the provincial legislature, and that anyone who says otherwise should be considered an enemy to Virginia. The Stamp Act Resolutions were the first formal opposition to the Stamp Act, and outlined the positions that would be taken up by protestors across the colonies.

Title: War of the Regulation
Description: The War of the Regulation was a class conflict in North Carolina. Poor farmers, strained by drought, economic turmoil, and an influx of wealthy lawyers and merchants in the west, grew angry at the corruption of public officlas. On June 6, 1765, George Sims gave the Nutbush Address, complaining about public officials charging Granville County residents fees. Officers were greedy and worked together to maximize their personal gain. Large percentages of taxes went to the collectors. The system of corruption was supported by William Tryon, North Carolina's governor. The poor citizens began organzing in protest of the system, intending to change the system to a more fair and honest one. In 1768, the organizers, called the Regulators, intruded in the colonial court while officials were trying several Regulator leaders and dragged who they viewed as corrupt officials through the streets. They then began rioting, destroying public and private property and beating several of the lawyers they viewed as antagonists. Edmund Fanning, the main opponent of the Regulators, received the worst of the beatings and his house was destroyed by the rioters. In 1771, Captain Benjamin Merrill, a Regulator leader, led a force of 2000 regulators against Governor Tryon and General Hugh Waddell's force of 1200 in Orange County. Merrill's intention was to use their superior numbers to scare Tryon into accepting his demands, but fighting soon broke out, at least a dozen were killed, and the Regulators surrendered. Most were pardoned, though six of the ringleaders were executed for treason, including Merrill. Tryon's militiamen then traveled through Regulator territory and forced those he found to sign loyalty oaths. Tryon was initially praised by the public, but upon further investigation was criticized for his harsh treatment of the Regulators, especially of his executions. Though the rebellion did not change much, some view it as one of the early fights in the Revolutionary War.

Title: Stamp Act Congress
Description: The Stamp Act Congress was a meeting of 27 delegates from the British colonies that took place in New York City in response to the passage of the Stamp Act by Parliament. The Massachusetts General Assembly issued a letter in June calling for delegates to meet in New York City to discuss how to respond to the new tax. Nine colonial legislatures, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, and South Carolina, appointed delegates to attend the meeting. The governors of Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia prevented their colonies from attending, and New Hampshire declined due her preoccupation with an economic crisis. Nova Scotia was a strong economic partner with Massachusetts, but were stronger partners with England, and so declined to attend. Newfoundland, Quebec, East Florida, and West Florida did not have legislatures and so were not invited. The Congress elected Timothy Ruggles as its chairmain, and included other famous delegates like future Articles of Confederation author John Dickinson and future chief justice John Rutledge. 

The Congressional deliberations were conducted in secret, and discussed how the colonies should respond to Parliament’s Sugar and Stamp Acts. They debated the differences between direct and indirect taxation. Traditionally, the British and the colonists had become accustomed the regulation of trade, such as import duties. This was called indirect taxation, and was exemplified by the Navigation Acts. The Stamp Act was a significant departure from this long-standing tradition by directly taxing items. On October 14, the Congress drafted and adopted the Declaration of Rights and Grievances, asserting fourteen points about the colonists’ rights as Englishmen and how Parliament was violating them. The Stamp Act Congress also wrote petitions to the king, House of Commons, and House of Lords asking them to repeal the tax, which were promptly ignored. Though the Stamp Act Congress was largely inconsequential in the attempt to repeal the Stamp Act, it was one of the first meetings of the British colonies to act as one voice, and the first of such to be conducted successfully. It prompted Parliament to pass the Declaratory Act, which intended to prevent such a meeting from taking place again. The Stamp Act Congress would later serve as inspiration for the 1774 and 1775 Continental Congresses.

Title: Declaration of Rights and Grievances
Description: A document passed by the Stamp Act Congress in protest of the eponymous tax passed by Great Britain earlier that year. The declaration consisted of the following fourteen points:

1) American colonists owe the Crown the same allegiance as those born in Great Britain do
2) American colonists are hence entitled to all the same rights that British subjects enjoy
3) Taxation without consent by the people or their representatives infringes upon those rights
4) American colonists cannot be represented by those in the House of Commons
5) Only elected colonial assemblies have the right to tax the colonists, as they are the only ones that are true representatives of the people
6) It goes against "the spirit of the British constitution" to give King George colonists' property
7) The right to a jury trial is another right that all British subjects are entitled to
8) The Stamp Act infringes upon the colonists' rights by extending the powers of the courts of admiralty
9) The payment of the new taxes are "impracticable"
10) Paying for the manufactures that the colonies are required to trade with results in King George amassing a large amount of wealth
11) The trade restriction placed on the colonies prevents the colonists from paying the manufactures
12) The happiness and success of the colonies depend on the full enjoyment of its people's rights, as well as a good relationship with Great Britain
13) British subjects have the right to petition both the king or Parliament.
14) It is the duty of the colonies to petition for the repeal of the Stamp Act

Title: Declaratory Act
Description: The Declaratory Act was an attempt by Parliament to assert its authority over the colonies. It followed the protests over the Sugar Act, and the even larger protests over the Stamp Act. Colonists objected to the Stamp Act in large part because they could not vote in parliamentary elections, and therefore believed they were not fairly represented in Parliament. It was an enumerated British right to not be taxed without representation, so colonists believed the Stamp Act violated their rights. Parliament conceded defeat and repealed the Stamp Act, but accompanied it with this declaration. It stated that Parliament in no uncertain terms had equal authority over the colonies as they did the island of Great Britain. It declared that the colonists did indeed have representation in Parliament, as did everyone else in the British Empire, even if it wasn't direct. Therefore, Parliament would consider the chant of "no taxation without representation" invalid. The colonists were not fans of the Declaratory Act, fearing it would open the door to taxes like the Stamp Act in the future. Parliament, for their part, would not pass a direct tax again, choosing to use customs and duties like the colonists were used to.

Title: Liberty Poles
Description: A liberty pole was a wooden pole with a Phrygian cap from the Netherlands on top. They served as symbols of displeasure with British authority and, of course, liberty. The first of these was erected in New York City on May 21, 1766, three days after the repeal of the highly unpopular Stamp Act, in celebration of the event. The British saw it as a symbol of defiance and a reminder of the New York government's refusal to enforce the tax, and chopped down the pole in August. Another pole came up quickly and was cut down as quickly. A third pole came up that stayed up until the next year, when British soldiers cut it down after seeing colonists use it to celebrate the Stamp Act repeal anniversary. A fourth pole was put up, secured by iron bands, but that too would come down. In this case, it was due to the Quartering Act controversy. New York saw the act as an infringement of liberty and refused to implement it, prompting Parliament to dissolve the provincial assembly and replace it with a more cooperative one. Outraged, the Sons of Liberty posted a broadside titled "To the Betrayed Inhabitants of the City and Colony of New York", complaining about the British decision. Angered by this broadside, British officials exploded the pole and posted their own pamphlets labeling the Sons of Liberty as enemies of society.

On January 19, 1770, merchant Isaac Sears gathered a group to prevent the soldiers from distributing these pamphlets. They captured a few soldiers, while a large number of New Yorkers and British soldiers appeared. The soldiers were outnumbered and began falling back to their barracks, but upon reaching Golden Hill, an officer ordered them to cut through the protestors with bayonets. A brief scuffle ensued, but another officer arrived and broke up the situation in time to prevent all but a few injuries. A final liberty pole was raised on February 6, which stayed up for good. Though a relatively minor conflict, the "Battle" of Golden Hill was the first real one between colonists and British soldiers, even before the Boston Massacre.

Title: <b>Townshend Act Crisis</b>
Description: The Townshend Act Crisis was a period of unrest in the British American colonies, over the Townshend Acts. These were a series of laws passed by Great Britain and orchestrated by British Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend. They consisted of the following:

1) The New York Restraining Act of 1767: Forbade the NY Assembly and governor from passing laws until they complied with the Quartering Act. This was never implemented because NY complied with the Quartering Act before it was passed.

2) The Revenue Act of 1767: Taxed glass, lead, paint, tea, oil, and paper. The taxes were indirect, being collected by regulating trade. It was implemented after the passionate and sometimes violent protests that erupted after the Stamp Act was passed, which directly taxed paper. Townshend believed that the Stamp Act being a direct tax was one of the main reasons colonists objected to it, and if Great Britain went back to the old method of taxing by regulating trade, which the long-standing Navigation Acts used, there would be less uproar. Indeed, though there were immediate protests from merchants, the initial reaction to the Townshend Acts were more muted than those to the Stamp Act. However, Townshend was incorrect in his belief; the colonists objected to the Stamp Act primarily because they believed they lacked real representation in Parliament. Great Britain had attempted to end this line of argument with the Declaratory Act in 1766, but that did not convince the colonists. Under this line of reasoning, the Townshend Acts were no different than the Stamp Act. Most controversially, the Revenue Act legalized "writs of assistance", or general warrants used by customs officials to search suspected smugglers for goods, which colonists feared violated their rights.

3) The Indemnity Act of 1767: Reduced taxes on tea sold by the British East India Company. The law was intended not only to keep British tea competitive with Dutch tea, which was often smuggled into the colonies, but also to keep the British East India Company afloat, as it had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.

4) The Commissioners of Customs Act of 1767: Created a Customs Board that enforced shipping regulations and increased tax revenue. Previously, customs were handled by the Customs Board in England, but was unable to enforce taxes in the colonies due to the large distance between them. The new Customs Board was established in Boston, and was much more active in its prosecutions, though was also rife with corruption.

5) The Vice Admiralty Act of 1768: Gave Royal naval courts, instead of colonial courts, jurisdiction over all matters concerning customs or smuggling. It was passed a year after the others, after Charles Townshend died. It was intended to aid the prosecution of smugglers, whom the British government feared would often get too light of a sentence from a local jury that may be benefiting from the smuggler's business. Suspected smugglers could already be tried in a Royal naval court in Halifax, Nova Scotia, but just one location was inconvenient to use if the smuggler lived far away. The Vice Admiralty Act opened new courts in Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston, which would dramatically increase the number of suspected smugglers tried in these courts. These courts were run entirely by royally appointed judges without option for a jury. Additionally, the judges would receive a 5% cut of any fine they levied on a smuggler they convicted. Finally, suspected smugglers were required to travel to the courts on their own expense, and were found automatically guilty if they did not show.

Though Townshend knew these laws would be controversial, he was not prepared for the level of outrage that came from the colonies. Colonists maintained that the Townshend Acts were "taxation without representation" and was unconstitutional. They feared the writs of assistance and vice admiralty courts further violated their rights. Especially outrageous was the fact that the money raised from the Revenue Act would go towards paying the salaries of colonial governors and judges. This simultaneously took money from the colonies and placed the already royally appointed governors and judges even more under the thumb of Great Britain. 

In protest, John Dickinson anonymously wrote a series of twelve essays collectively titled, "Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania", in which he rejected the new import duties as just as illegitimate as the Stamp Act and encouraged all colonists to stand up against the Townshend Acts, especially Massachusetts, who had become famous for its protests since the Stamp Act Crisis. He sent the letters to James Otis of Massachusetts, who vehemently protested the writs of assistance. The Massachusetts House of Representatives issued a circular letter, written by Samuel Adams, attempting to recruit colonies to a resistance movement against the Townshend Acts. Several colonies, including Massachusetts, sent petitions to King George III to repeal the laws, to no avail. Virginia and Pennsylvania also sent petitions to Parliament, which refused to even consider them. Shocked by the Massachusetts Circular Letter, British Colonial Secretary Lord Hillsborough ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to order the House of Representatives to rescind the letter. The legislature refused, and was dissolved by Bernard as punishment. They were not allowed to convene until the end of May the next year, and even then the representatives found British cannons pointing at their meeting place. When the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a resolution declaring Parliament had no right to tax them without representation, they were dissolved by their governor as well.

Meanwhile, colonists began boycotting British goods in protest. Boston merchants organized the first non-importation agreement on January 1 1768, calling for the suspension of purchasing certain British goods. A similar agreement, called the Virginia Association, was organized in the eponymous colony by George Washington and George Mason. Some women spun and wove textiles themselves for colonists to purchase instead of British goods, nicknamed the Daughters of Liberty. Colonists felt that the boycotts gave them a spirit of virtuous self-sacrifice, as opposed to British extravagance. Virginian planters supported the boycott, as many of them were in debt and could use the boycott as an excuse to stop purchasing British goods without appearing to be struggling financially. Urban artisans enjoyed less overseas competition from the boycott, of which they quickly became fervent supporters. The boycott was moderately successful, reducing British imports by 38%, but that was not as much as the organizers had hoped for.

The new Customs Board was based in Boston, sensible as it was one of the largest port cities in the British North American colonies. However, it was also the source of the most passionate anti-tax protests, both for the Stamp Act in 1765 and now the Townshend Acts. The protests were so powerful that military assistance was required to enforce the customs. In May 1768, the HMS Romney, a fifty-gun warship, arrived in Boston Harbor for this purpose. The Romney began impressing Bostonian sailors, and in June captured a sloop called the Liberty run by merchant John Hancock, on suspicion of smuggling. Bostonians began to riot in protest, causing the customs officials to flee to Castle William for protection. Hillsborough ordered Bernard to search for evidence of treason. If he found any, suspects would be extradited to Great Britain for the trial. Though no evidence of treason was found, the threat shocked Bostonians. Hancock was tried in a vice admiralty court for smuggling, defended by lawyer John Adams, in a highly publicized trial, but charges were eventually dropped. Great Britain had already decided to send troops into Boston to quell the protests, but after the Liberty riots General Thomas Gage was convinced to send four regiments (4000 soldiers). The news caused quite an alarm in Boston; Samuel Adams convened an extralegal meeting between towns and passed a resolution protesting what they saw as an occupation, but was unable to stop the troops from arriving on October 1. The anonymously written "Journal of Occurences" tracked clashes between Bostonians and troops. On February 22, 1770, a Bostonian teenager was killed by a customs official. Though the troops were not involved, it only increased tensions between them and the Bostonians. This tension culminated on March 5, when Bostonians harassing the soldiers were fired upon, with five deaths, known as the Boston Massacre.

On the same day as the massacre, though only by coincidence, as news traveled slowly at the time and no one outside of Boston knew of the incident that day, Lord North, the new Prime Minister, called for the repeal of the Townshend Acts. It was agreed upon that all the acts would be repealed except for the tax on tea, in order to continue asserting Parliament's legitimacy in taxing the colonies. Despite being partial, the repeal was considered a success for the colonial protestors, who ended the non-importation. Merchants began paying for large amounts of British tea, tax included, though mainly in Boston; smuggled Dutch tea remained supreme in New York City and Philadelphia.

In a sense, the Townshend Acts Crisis was merely a repetition of the Stamp Act Crisis, though this time with added stakes. Now 4000 troops were stationed in Boston, five colonists were killed by said troops, rioters were threatened with treason, and the colonists were angrier than ever. The next law on the colonies and subsequent protest would only escalate the situation further.

Title: <i>Liberty</i> Riot
Description: A riot that broke out after the detaining of the Liberty, a sloop captained by John Hancock, a wealthy Bostonian merchant and future American revolutionary. The Liberty had been detained because of an accusation that he had been attempting to evade paying duties for bottles of wine he was carrying. British customs officials seized the sloop and towed it away towards the HMS Romney, an illegal act. Bostonians were also mad that the Romney had been impressing American sailors, and began to riot against the British. The customs officials reported back to Great Britain, complaining that they felt unsafe in Boston. In response, 4000 British troops were sent to the city to maintain order. The Liberty was commissioned into the Royal Navy but was soon burned by angry locals in Newport, RI. Tensions grew between the Bostonians and troops, which erupted in the 1770 Boston Massacre.

Title: Pennamite-Yankee Wars
Description: The Pennamite-Yankee Wars were a border dispute between Pennsylvania (the Pennamites) and Connecticut (the Yankees) over the Wyoming Valley. Not to be confused with the modern-day state, the Wyoming Valley is located southeast of Lake Erie. Both Pennsylvania and Connecticut had been granted access to the land through their charters, and had both purchased it from the native Susquehannocks, creating a border dispute. In 1769, Connecticut attempted to assert its claim by sending settlers to establish the town of Wilkes-Barre. Pennsylvania countered by sending armed settlers to drive the Yankees out of Wilkes-Barre. Though called a war, there were only three casualties throughout the entire thirty years. In 1773, King George III confirmed Connecticut to have the legitimate claim, prompting Yankees to form another town, Westmoreland, in the region, but the Pennamites again forcefully drove them out. The dispute remained through 1782, when the Confederate Congress overturned the king's decree and declared Pennsylvania to have the right to the Wyoming Valley. However, the Pennamites once again insisted on driving the Yankees out of the region, feeling as if they were not truly in control if the Yankees were still there. The conflict escalated in 1784, when Vermont and Connecticut began sending armed men to the Wyoming Valley to defend the settlers, and Pennsylvania sent General John Armstrong. Armstrong negotiated a truce between the two sides, but then took the Yankees prisoner when they were defenseless, turning public favor towards the Yankees. The dispute was finally resolved in 1799, when it was agreed that Pennsylvania would get to control the Wyoming Valley if the Yankees were allowed to remain in their settlements and become Pennsylvanian citizens. The 1782 decision is the only interstate dispute resolved by the Confederate Congress.

Title: <b>Boston Massacre</b>
Description: The Boston Massacre was a brawl between Boston civilians and British soldiers. Boston had for the last decade been the hotbed of unrest against perceived British transgressions against colonists' rights. This unrest prompted Parliament and British General Thomas Gage to send 4000 troops into the city. The tension only worsened from there, especially upon the death of Christopher Seider, an eleven-year-old boy killed by a customs employee on February 22, 1770. The tension was bound to erupt, and came to a head just a few weeks after Seider's death. On March 5, Private Hugh White stood guard outside the Boston Customs House when he began to be harassed by a small group of civilians, including 13-year-old Edward Garrick, who began poking White in the chest. White smacked Garrick with his musket in retaliation, attracting a larger crowd. Church bells, normally used to warn townspeople of fires, were rung, drawing people out of their homes and increasing the crowd size to around fifty. The civilians were led by a half-black, half-Indian former slave named Crispus Attucks, who began throwing snowballs at White and challenging him to fire at the crowd.

The commotion attracted the attention of Captain Thomas Preston, the officer at a nearby barracks, who dispatched an officer and six privates to defend White. The reinforcements muscled their way through the crowd to the customs house stairs, where White had retreated to. By this point, the crowd numbered in the hundreds. One of the Bostonians, Henry Knox, warned Captain Preston that if the soldiers fired, they would have to die. The crowd began hurling rocks and oyster shells at the soldiers, and dared them to open fire. A civilian, Richard Palmes, approached Preston with a cudgel and asked if the soldiers' rifles were loaded. Preston told him that they were, but they would not fire unless he ordered it, which he was not likely to do as he was standing directly in front of his men. One of the soldiers, Private Hugh Montgomery, was then knocked over by a thrown object, prompting him to fire his musket into the crowd despite not receiving an order to do so. Palmes then swung his cudgel at both Montgomery and Preston. After a brief pause, the soldiers began opening fire indiscriminately into the crowd without orders, hitting eleven. Three civilians died instantly, including Crispus Attucks, ropemaker Samuel Gray, and mariner James Caldwell. Two more died of their wounds later; 17-year-old apprentice Samuel Maverick the next morning, and Irish immigrant Patrick Carr two weeks later. Attucks' death is often considered the first of the American Revolution.

The crowd withdrew from the immediate area but began growing elsewhere. Preston called for more reinforcements to gather outside the customs office, and even Governor Thomas Hutchinson arrived, who managed to calm the crowd slightly by promising an inquiry. Preston and the eight soldiers were arrested, and the governor's council voted to recall the rest of the troops stationed in Boston to nearby Castle William. Secretary of State Andrew Oliver wrote that if the troops had not been recalled, the people likely would have attacked them further, which would provoke Parliament to declare the colony to be in rebellion and revoke their charter.

A fierce propaganda battle ensued between the two political factions in Boston, the Patriots and Loyalists, both determined to spin the events of March 5 to suit their agenda. The Boston Gazette criticized the presence of troops in the city, and cited the event an ongoing attempt to "quell a Spirit of Liberty". By far the most effective and famous piece of propaganda was produced by Patriot silversmith Henry Pelham. He created an engraving of the event, depicting Preston ordering an ordered row of soldiers to fire into a helpless crowd outside "Butcher's Hall". Fellow silversmith Paul Revere copied the engraving and circulated it widely throughout the colonies. The engraving was also printed in the Boston Gazette, where it was called a "massacre". For many, this interpretation was the only perspective they had on the event, which of course enraged them against the British troops.

The Massachusetts government wished to give the soldiers a fair trial so as to not draw ire from Great Britain and to not alienate moderates from the Patriot movement. John Adams, a Patriot who had written the Braintree Instructions during the Stamp Act crisis, was asked to defend the soldiers. The trial began on November 27. Adams described the Bostonian crowd as a "motley rabble of saucy boys" and other unsavory characters. He argued that Attucks appeared dangerous and acted overly aggressively towards the soldiers, and that they had only fired in retaliation for repeated attacks. The surgeon of Patrick Carr testified that the immigrant forgave whoever shot him, believing that it was only in self-defense. The jury agreed with Adams and acquitted six of the soldiers, convicting the other two of manslaughter because of strong evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. This verdict suggests the jury believed the soldiers were justified in defending themselves but should have waited for orders before firing. The convicted soldiers had their sentences reduced from death to branding of the thumb. Four of the civilians involved in the massacre were also tried, but were all acquitted.

The Boston Massacre is considered to be one of the most important events in the American Revolution. The propagandistic engraving played a large part in turning public colonial opinion against British authority. It would be just the first in a series of violent outbursts between colonists and Brits in the years to come.

Title: <i>Gaspee</i> Affair
Description: The HMS Gaspee was a schooner captained by Lieutenant William Dudingston whose job was to enforce the Navigation Acts by collecting customs from merchants in port towns. Parliament was still in need of money, both to pay off the debts it accrued from the Seven Years' War and to pay the troops stationed in the North American colonies. They had previously tried to pay these with the Stamp Act tax, but was unsuccessful because of the outrage and objection from the colonists over its legality. The Navigation Acts, part of which levied import duties on various goods, were still in effect, however, and had been so since 1561. Great Britain hoped that such an old tax would draw less attention than one recently passed like the Stamp Act.

The Gaspee in particular was assigned to Narragansett Bay by the Province of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, arriving in February 1772. Alongside Boston, Rhode Island was especially hostile to these customs ships, as much of their revenue depended on trade and they viewed the Navigation Acts as threats to their business. In years prior fellow customs schooners like the HMS St John and the HMS Liberty had been attacked by angry sailors. The Gaspee was hostile in return, gaining a reputation for aggressive behavior in Narragansett Bay. On February 17, the Gaspee seized a boat called the Fortune, confiscating its shipment of rum. Dudingston sent the Fortune to Boston to await trial. Providencers objected strongly, pointing out that the colony's royal charter specified that an arrest that took place in the colony must hold the trial in the colony as well.

On the night of June 9, the Gaspee was chasing the Hannah, a packet ship (a medium-sized passenger and freight boat), and ran aground in the shallow waters of the northwestern section of the bay. Dudingston decided to wait until high tide in the hopes that the ship would be set free, but before that could happen a group of angry Rhode Islanders, many of whom were Sons of Liberty, led by local merchant John Brown showed up, taking opportunity of the Gaspee's vulnerability to get rid of it. The group rowed up to the boat in the early morning of June 10 and captured the boat. Dudingston was shot in the groin by Joseph Bucklin and the Gaspee was burned.

Though prior customs boat attacks had gone unpunished, Great Britain this time decided to put its foot down. It gathered the Royal Commission of Inquiry, made up of the chiefs of the supreme courts of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, the judge of the vice-admiralty of Boston, and Governor Joseph Wanton of Rhode Island. The Commission was tasked with finding evidence of treason, the finding of which would mean extradition to England for the suspects to be tried. Though the Commission was unable to find any such evidence, colonists were nonetheless shocked at the prospect. Most condemned the burning of the Gaspee, but saw the treason charge as a gross overreaction. The Virginia House of Burgesses established intercolonial committees of correspondence. The Reverend John Allen took advantage of the incident to preach about greedy monarchs and corrupt judges in England, a sermon that was printed and circulated widely throughout the colonies. This incident was just one of many that led to rising tensions between Great Britain and her colonies.

Title: <b>Tea Act</b>
Description: An act granting the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in America. The company was highly profitable to the British Empire, but was beginning to fail due to a lack of sales of tea. Desperate to keep it afloat, Parliament passed the Tea Act, hoping that a monopoly on the colonial market would help the company rebound. However, the colonists were less than pleased with this turn of affairs, who were once again upset that such major economic decisions that affected their livelihood were being made without their consent or with any say in their passage. Less than a year later, the Sons of Liberty organized the Boston Tea Party as an act of defiance against the tax and the 1773 act.

The Tea Act was passed by Parliament primarily to assist the failing East India Company. The business was highly profitable for the British Empire, but was struggling, due in part to a lack of tea sales. The British East India Company sold tea wholesale to colonial merchants, who put it up for retail sale for the end consumer. The British government charged the merchants a tax every time they purchased this tea from the company. While the tax was lowered in 1767 by the one remaining Townshend Act, it was still money the merchants did not want to pay. Cheaper for them was Dutch tea, which charged no such import duties. Legally, colonial merchants were required to purchase exclusively British tea, so any Dutch tea they possessed was classified as smuggled property. Nevertheless, merchants were usually willing to take the risk of being caught. Great Britain and her American colonies were large markets for the smuggled tea, and the British East India Company was losing £400,000 a year from it. The Dutch tea was generally considered lower in quality, though drinking it was encouraged by the Sons of Liberty as a form of protest against the Townshend Acts. The British East India Company, which supplied the tea, was in dire financial straits due to a famine in Bengal that limited its supply, low sales in Europe, and contractual annual payments to the British government, and the lack of tea sales in America was not helping.

Prime Minister Lord North resolved to solve these issues with the Tea Act. This allowed the East India Company to export tea directly to the colonies, without having to sell it to merchants or pay import duties. Since both import duties and the markups merchants made to make a profit while retail selling made the tea more expensive, in effect the Tea Act made tea much cheaper for colonists. The idea was to make British tea cheaper than smuggled Dutch tea, encouraging the colonists to purchase the former, helping out the company in its time of need. Additionally, the Townshend Act tax on tea, which the colonists had been complaining was passed without their representation and so was illegitimate, would still apply to the British tea. Therefore, if the colonists wanted to purchase the cheaper tea, they would be forced to accept the tax and Parliament's ability to levy them.

The tea tax had been around since 1767, but had not caused much uproar since the other Townshend Acts were repealed, since most merchants were buying smuggled tea and didn't have to pay the tax, so they didn't pay it much mind. But the Tea Act would force them to pay it, which would bring up the same objections the colonists had had to it back during the Townshend Act Crisis. When the Tea Act was passed, removing the tax was debated, as some members of Parliament feared that it would stoke another unnecessary controversy in the colonies. But Lord North wanted the revenue the tax provided to pay the colonial governors and judges, in order to remove influence from the legislatures.

It was on mainly this final point, as well as the old "no taxation without representation", that colonists would end up objecting to this act. Merchants, who had a large presence in port cities like Boston, also feared that their business would be threatened by them being cut out of tea sales. As usual, the colonists protested the latest objectionable Parliamentary action. In New York City and Philadelphia, tea was returned to Great Britain, and those selling the tea were forced to resign. In Charleston, the same happened, except the tea was abandoned at the harbor. Most shocking of all, however, came once again from Boston, as a group of Sons of Liberty raided a ship and dumped its entire cargo of tea into the harbor. This incident enraged Great Britain and led to the passage of the Intolerable Acts, a major step towards the American Revolution.

Title: <b>Boston Tea Party</b>
Description: The Boston Tea Party was a protest organized by the Boston Sons of Liberty in objection to the 1768 tea tax and 1773 Tea Act. The Tea Act was controversial across the colonies, and soon after its passage protests erupted in Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Charleston, where the first shipments of British tea were sent. In the latter three cities, protestors were successfully able to force those selling the tea to resign, and in New York City and Philadelphia the tea cargo ships were sent back to Great Britain. Boston protestors, led by Samuel Adams, planned something similar, but Governor Thomas Hutchinson prevented the ships from leaving. By law, the tea had to have import duties paid within twenty days of the ship arriving in the harbor, else it could be confiscated by customs officials. With Bostonians refusing to pay the duty and unload the tea, and Hutchinson refusing to let the ships, that twenty-day deadline passed on December 16.

Realizing their protest was going nowhere, between 30 and 130 Bostonians resolved to raid three of the ships. A few of the protestors dressed up as Mohawk Indians to hide their identity, due to the illegality of what they were about to do. Mohawk Indians were chosen because they, and other Indian tribes, were often seen by the colonists as symbols of America. The protestors boarded the ships and threw their entire cargo of tea into Boston Harbor. 342 chests, or 92,000 pounds of tea were thrown overboard, costing the British East India Company £9,659, or roughly 1.7 million modern-day US dollars. None of the ship's crew were injured, and the protestors took great care not to damage anything on the ships besides the tea. All that was damaged was a padlock, which was replaced the next day by the Whigs. The incident was known at the time as "the destruction of the tea", but in 1834 was called "the Boston Tea Party", which it is referred to as today.

It is unknown whether Samuel Adams arranged the protest, but he publicized and defended it, arguing that the perpetrators were protecting their constitutional rights. This time, it was Great Britain's turn to be shocked. Even members of Parliament who normally defended the colonists condemned what they saw as lawless violence and destruction of property. The idea that the protestors should get away free was not uncontroversial even among Whigs; Benjamin Franklin reccomended that the East India Company be compensated for its losses. New York merchant Robert Murray approached Lord North and offered to do just that, but was turned down. Instead, Parliament resolved to punish the whole of Boston with a vengeance. The punishments were called "the Coercive Acts" in Great Britain, but were nicknamed "the Intolerable Acts" in the colonies. The Boston Tea Party and Intolerable Acts were major contributors to the American Revolution. Similar demonstrations occurred across the colonies, indicating that it was not just Boston that objected. The Boston Tea Party enraged Great Britain, and the Intolerable Acts terrified the colonies, some of whom began arming themselves, which would lead to the first battles of the Revolutionary War.

Title: <b>Intolerable Acts</b>
Description: The Intolerable Acts were a series of four laws passed to punish Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party. They consisted of the following: 

1) Boston Port Act: Passed on March 31, it authorized the Royal Navy to blockade Boston Harbor beginning June 1. Parliament claimed that business could no longer be properly conducted in the region if they were in danger of being raided by protesters like the tea ships were during the Boston Tea Party. Parliament declared that the harbor would be closed indefinitely until the province had paid for the £10,000 (approximately 1.7 million modern-day USD) of tea destroyed in the Tea Party and the king had ascertained that order had been restored and that Bostonians could respect British law. The blockade forbade any exports out of Massachusetts, whether to another colony or a foreign country. The only imports allowed were necessary goods like fuel and wheat. Because Boston was by far the largest city in Massachusetts, and Boston was primarily a port city, this act was a major threat to the province's economy. The colonists of course objected to this, as well as the fact that only a few dozen men perpetrated the Tea Party in the first place, and all of Boston suffered for it, was unfair.

2) Massachusetts Governing Act: Passed on May 20, it declared Massachusetts to be under mob rule and therefore revoked the provincial charter. Nearly all elected positions in the provincial government were now to be appointed by Parliament, the king, or the (himself royally appointed) governor. For example, the previously popularly elected Massachusetts Council become entirely royally appointed. The governor could choose judges and county sheriffs without the Council's approval. The county sheriffs could select jurors. Since sheriffs made arrests and chose who would decide the accused's verdict, Massachusett's justice system became far less impartial and far more under the sheriffs' influences. Town meetings were also limited to just one a year, rendering them effectively useless. Combined with the several thousand British troops in Boston, the Province of Massachusetts had essentially come under the direct rule of Great Britain, and colonists had lost their autonomy.

3) Administration of Justice Act: Passed on May 20, it allowed royal officials accused of crimes to be tried in Great Britain if the governor decided that they could not obtain a fair trial in Massachusetts. However, since the suspected crime was committed in Massachusetts, all witnesses would have to be transported to Great Britain for the trial as well. Though the law required these witnesses be reimbursed for their travel expenses, they would still be missing work, and therefore money, while they were away, which would not be reimbursed. Because transatlantic voyages lasted over a month and the trial would likely last at least a few weeks, the witnesses could be away for a while. Many could not afford to attend these trials. But more than that, colonists objected to what they saw as their rights being violated. The Magna Carta guaranteed British subjects the right to a trial by a jury of their peers, which the accused would not be getting. They also feared that ironically to the written intent of the law, the trials in Great Britain would be biased in favor of the accused, allowing them to get away with any crime. George Washington went as far as to call it the "Murder Act". Colonists also saw the law as unnecessary, believing the British soldiers on trial for the Boston Massacre three years prior received a fair trial (most were acquitted entirely), so there was no need for the change in location.

4) Quartering Act: Passed on June 2, it allowed for the quartering of soldiers in civilian areas. Parliament had already passed a Quartering Act in 1765 that allowed soldiers to be quartered in various public and private buildings (though never private residencies) and required colonists to pay for their supplies. However, most colonies were uncooperative, and found ways to avoid following the intent of the law. The new Quartering Act allowed the governor to force compliance, but in return dropped the requirement of footing the bill for supplying the soldiers. Like the last Quartering Act but unlike the rest of the Intolerable Acts, this applied to all the colonies, not just Massachusetts. Like last time, the colonists objected to having to quarter soldiers in peacetime where they could be constantly threatened.

5) Quebec Act: Passed on June 22, it was not created in direct response to the Boston Tea Party, but came around the same time and caused a similar level of outrage in the colonies, so it is sometimes included in the Intolerable Acts. It dramatically expanded the border of Quebec to include the entire Ohio River Valley, directly west of the Thirteen Colonies. This land was highly sought after; many of the colonists fought for it in the French and Indian War, but had been prohibited from settling there by the Royal Proclamation of 1763. Now, not only would they not get any of it for certain, but it was being given to Quebec, inhabited by the very French settlers they fought against for it. Furthermore, the law legalized the practice of Catholicism, the dominant religion amongst French Canadiens. Most of the Thirteen Colonies were Protestant, especially Massachusetts, which was one of the largest and most outspoken of the colonies. They vehemontly opposed Catholicism, and hated that it was being allowed right on their front door. The royal governor and Crown were given complete control over Quebec, and a union of British and French civil law were implemented, which ended up excluding trial by jury. The colonists had already been beginning to believe Great Britain was no longer respecting the colony's self-determination or their right to trial by jury, and the Quebec Act seemed to confirm their suspicions. They feared that they all would soon end up like Quebec, full of Catholics and ruled without their consent. Overall, the colonists found the provisions of the Quebec Act outrageous.

Parliament, who had named these laws the Coercive Acts, intended for them to gain better control over the rebellious Massachusetts and break its spirit. Each act was meant to damage life in some way: the Boston Port Act ruined the economy and increased unemployment, the Massachusetts Governing Act essentially removed representative government, the Administration of Justice Act removed the right to a fair trial, and the Quartering Act provided a thinly veiled threat if the province didn't comply. The Quebec Act challenged the notion amongst the colonists that the French and Indian War, which saw thousands of colonists' deaths, was fought for Protestantism and popular sovereignty.

It is at this point unsurprising that the colonies, Massachusetts especially, did not react well to these. They called them the Intolerable Acts, and thought that the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts were trivial compared to these. In response to those acts, the colonies had created Committees of Correspondence in order to coordinate their resistance efforts. Now they decided to formalize the correspondence by creating the Continental Congress, composed of delegates selected by each colonial legislature. This Congress would meet up in one location, decide a plan of action, and report back to their respective colonies. The Congress resolved to send a petition directly to the king and establish a large-scale boycott of British goods.

The Intolerable Acts caused a dramatic change in the colonies. While few were fans of the tea tax and Tea Act, many of even the most outspoken colonial Whigs, like George Washington, questioned the Boston Tea Party as perhaps going too far. But the Intolerable Acts were seen as a gross overreaction and a direct affront to the liberty of the inhabitants of Massachusetts, and the other colonists feared that Great Britain was willing and able to subject them to the same punishments. Great Britain had not expected the level of unity and coordination amongst the colonies, even more so than during the Stamp Act protests. Colonists from as far away as Georgia sent supplies to Massachusetts to compensate them for their closed port. Unlike the Stamp Act and Townshend Act Crises, Great Britain refused to be intimidated by the colonies, and would not repeal the acts. They were determined to get the colonies under control once and for all.

With the passage of these acts, tension between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies were at an all-time high. Colonists, feeling threatened by these acts, began stockpiling weapons en masse. Less than a year after the Intolerable Acts were passed, the colonists and British troops would begin skirmishes, which soon turned into a full-blown war.

Title: Lord Dunmore's War
Description: Lord Dunmore's War was a conflict between Virginian settlers and Shawnee and Mingo tribesmen. The war was named after Virginia Governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, who convinced the Virginia House of Burgesses to declare war with the Native Americans to push them out of the upper Ohio Valley. The most powerful tribe in the region was the Iroquois Confederacy, who had long since held claim to the land south of the Ohio River, though other tribes claimed the land as well. In 1768, British officials had signed the Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the Iroquois Confederacy, which relinquished the tribe's claims to the land.

Following the treaty, Virginian settlers began pushing west, though numerous other powerful tribes in the region, most notably the Shawnee, refused to recognize the treaty and maintained their claims. One such settling party was led by James Boone, the 16-year-old son of hunter Daniel Boone, which on October 9, 1773, was attacked by a force of allied Indians. Boone and Henry Russell, another teenager, were tortured to death as a message against Virginian settlement west. Though attempts were made by Captain Micheal Cresap, leader of the settlers in Ohio, to keep the peace, too many settlers wanted war. It was declared on April 26, 1774, with fighting beginning at Pipe Creek the next day. 

On April 30, a group of settlers brutally attacked defenseless relatives of the Mingo leader Logan in an event known as the Yellow Creek Massacre. Lord Dunmore organized a militia force, hoping that the war would divert Virginians' attention away from the protests in New England. Colonel Andrew Lewis established Point Pleasant on October 6 and was ambushed there by warriors led by Chief Cornstalk four days later. The Native American Ohio Confederate forces were defeated, and as Dunmore's forces pushed deeper into their territory peace negotiations opened. The Treaty of Camp Charlotte was signed on October 18, which ended the conflict between the Virginians and the Shawnee. The Shawnee also had to agree to stop hunting south of Ohio and harassing white settlers in the area. However, the Mingo refused to sign the treaty, leading Major William Crawford to destroy their nearby village of Seekunk. The Mingo surrendered soon after. However, peace did not last, with the Shawnee attacking Virginian settlers as early as March 1775. Dunmore's hopes of distracting the Virginians were not fulfilled, with the colonists even declaring the willingness to use force to defend their rights if necessary.

Title: Quebec Act
Description: A law passed by British Parliament that granted French Canadians from Quebec access to the Ohio River Valley, which the British had won from the French and Indian War. British colonists were upset by the law, claiming that they were barred from the territory they had fought in a war for (because of the Royal Proclamation Line), but their enemies (the French) were allowed to reign free in it. It is sometimes considered part of the Intolerable (Coercive) Acts.

Title: First Continental Congress
Description: The First Continental Congress was a group of 56 delegates from 12 colonies (excluding Georgia, a relatively new colony compared to the others) who discussed the dangers of the Intolerable Acts, which had placed Massachusetts under martial law. The other colonies feared that they might be next, so they sent their best politicians to decide what to do. Their president was Peyton Randolph (until October 22, when Henry Middleton presided instead) and their secretary was Charles Thomson. Famous members included John Adams and Samuel Adams from Massachusetts, John Jay from New York, John Dickinson from Pennsylvania, and Patrick Henry and George Washington from Virginia. Though there was much debate and disagreement over a plan of action, they eventually decided to organize a boycott of British goods across the 12 colonies starting in December. Every colonial assembly but New York agreed, and committees were established to ensure the boycott was followed. They also threatened the West Indies colonies with a boycott if they did not join in. In 1775, imports from Great Britain dropped to 3% of their 1774 levels. They also agreed to arrange a Second Continental Congress the next year. Their last convention was on October 26.

The First Continental Congress was a meeting of delegates from twelve American colonies to discuss a coordinated reaction to the Intolerable Acts. These were a series of four acts passed by Parliament and King George III designed to punish Boston and Massachusetts at large for the Boston Tea Party, which the British viewed as unjustified destruction of property and a grave insult to the British Empire. In turn, colonists saw the Intolerable Acts as, well, intolerable. Though most of the acts only affected Massachusetts, the other colonies felt solidarity with whom they saw as fellow British subjects being deprived of their rights. Plus, they feared that if they did not act now, they might share a similar fate to Massachusetts. By the late spring of 1774, nine colonies, represented by their legislatures or committees of correspondence, called for a continental congress to be convened, a call led by the Virginia Committee of Correspondence. Georgia was the only colony of the thirteen that would eventually secede that did not attend. The Loyalist cause was stronger there, as it was still a young colony compared to the other twelve, and so more dependent on British assistance, especially with constant threats of fighting with Indians on the frontier and in neighboring Florida.

Fifty-six delegates attended, convening in Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia on September 5. Prominent members included John Adams and Samuel Adams of Massachusetts, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, John Jay of New York, John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, Patrick Henry, Richard Henry Lee, Peyton Randolph, and George Washington of Virginia, and John Rutledge of South Carolina. The Congress elected Randolph as president and Charles Thomson as secretary. As previously mentioned, the delegates were there to discuss a planned reaction to the Intolerable Acts. Conservatives like John Jay, Joseph Galloway, John Dickinson, and Edward Rutledge wanted to form policies to pressure Parliament into repealing the punitive measures. More radical members like Henry, Sherman, and the Adamses wanted to draft a declaration of rights of the colonists to end parliamentary abuse of those rights. Henry went as far as to call for a new, continental government to be formed, implying the colonies' independence. Galloway countered by proposing a pan-colonial government that Great Britain would require consent from to pass certain measures, instead of full independence. It would have consisted of a President-General appointed by the Crown and delegates appointed by colonial legislatures. This idea was remarkably similar to Benjamin Franklin's proposal in the Albany Convention twenty years prior.

Ultimately, neither proposal won out. Instead, the Congress endorsed the Suffolk Resolves, a declaration made by the Committees of Correspondence meeting in Suffolk County, MA. It called on citizens of Massachusetts to disregard the Massachusetts Governing Act, and until it was repealed, boycott British imports and products, reduce exports to Great Britain, refuse to pay taxes, and even form a now-illegal government and raise a militia. The Resolves were passed on September 9, and Paul Revere had delivered a copy of them to the Continental Congress a few days later, where it was endorsed on September 17 as a show of solidarity.

Next, the Congress began drafting the Continental Association. This was a plan to end British imports into the colonies by December 1774 and end exporting to Great Britain by September 1775.

Title: Declaration and Resolves
Description: A document written by the First Continental Congress in protest of the Intolerable Acts. In a manner similar to the Declaration of Rights and Grievances issued nine years prior by the First Continental Congress' predecessor, the Stamp Act Congress, it declared the colony's contempt towards the Intolerable Acts. It outlined the rights a British subject ought to enjoy, and claimed the acts infringed on those rights. It also suggested that neither the king nor Parliament had the authority to do so, because they did not truly represent the interests of the colonists. While King George recognized this as further evidence of the colonists' dislike of the punitive measures in Massachusetts, he refused to yield, stressing political unity over the happiness of the colonists. With a clear outline of the wrongdoings of the British government, more people began to seek independence from the mother country.

Title: Continental Association
Description: A system drafted by the First Continental Congress in an attempt to boycott British goods in protest of the Intolerable Acts. It began with a profession of loyalty to the Crown, signifying that Americans were not yet ready to divorce from Great Britain. It proposed an immediate and total ban of British tea, and a ban on the importation or consumption of any goods (including slaves) from Britain, Ireland, or the British West Indies, which took effect on December 1. It threatened the cessation of exportation of goods to said locations if the Intolerable Acts were not repealed by September 10, 1775. Local committees would be established to monitor these events, and anyone caught defying the boycott would be condemned in print and labeled as an enemy of the people. Furthermore, any colony not complying with the Association would be prohibited from trading with any other colony. The boycott was successful, with imports from the blacklisted countries dropping to 3% of what they were the year before. In response, Great Britain blocked the colonies from trading with anyone but the mother country or its other colonies, as well as banning them from the North Atlantic fishing areas. The outbreak of the Revolutionary War in April 1775 effectively led to the discontinuation of the Association. It was the largest coordinated effort between the colonies up to that point, as the thirteen had been mostly divided since their inception.

Title: Petition to the King
Description: A petition sent to King George III of Great Britain requesting the repeal of the 1774 Intolerable Acts. It was written by an appointed committee consisting of Richard Henry Lee (the chair), John Adams, Patrick Henry, Thomas Johnson, and John Rutledge. They began writing the draft on October 1 and was ratified by Congress on the 25th after some amendments. It was signed by 51 of the 56 Congressional delegates and sent to London, arriving on November 14. It was examined by the House of Commons on January 19 of the next year, where it was mostly disregarded and not formally replied to. The Petition showed that even though the colonists were becoming increasingly upset with the actions of the British government, they still wished to remain loyal to the Crown as late as October 1774.

Title: Battles of Lexington and Concord
Description: Start of the Revolutionary War. British soldiers found out that colonists were stockpiling ammunition for a revolution in Concord, so they came to put it down. Soldiers were intercepted at Lexington, as riders like Paul Revere and Samuel Prescott had forewarned the Patriots of the British arrival. It is unknown which side fired the first shot, but it was nicknamed "the shot heard round the world," and marked the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. The militia was outnumbered at Lexington, forcing them to retreat to Concord, where they received a large number of reinforcements. At Concord, the rebels were the ones with superior numbers, and managed to chase the British troops out of the city. The British retreated to Boston, being harassed by militiamen on they way back. The defeat was humiliating for the British, as they had one of, if not the strongest and best-trained army in the world, and yet they lost to poorly trained militiamen.

Description: The Green Mountain Boys led by Ethan Allen, along with a small force of American militiamen led by Benedict Arnold, captured British Fort Ticonderoga in northern NY, a vital communications and supply point connecting Canada with New York. It also had lots of guns and ammunition for the Patriots to use. They attacked at night, while the British were asleep and off-guard, causing them to surrender with practically no resistance. Henry Knox (future Secretary of War under George Washington) would later take these weapons and use oxen to drag them through the snow all the way to Boston.

Title: Battle of Bunker Hill
Description: On June 13, following intelligence that the British would try to take Boston Harbor, Congress sent 1200 troops to defend Bunker Hill and nearby Breed's Hill. On June 17, the British mounted an assault against the militia, charging three times to take the hills. The militia repelled them the first two times, but ran out of ammunition by the third attempt. The Patriot soldiers were famously ordered "Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes" in order to increase accuracy to save ammunition. However, this was still not enough, and the Americans were forced to retreat. While the British were victorious in the battle, they suffered more casualties and learned that the untrained American militia could face off successfully against well-organized armies.

Title: Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms
Description: A document written by Congressman John Dickinson (who borrowed much of the text from Thomas Jefferson) that explained the reasoning behind the American Revolutionary War. Specifically, it explained that the colonists found the Intolerable Acts, the taxes, and the Declaratory Act as examples of Great Britain attempting to unconstitutionally assert its dominance over the colonies. It assured the British that the colonists did not seek independence, and that they would end their rebellion if the oppression would stop. However, the document was published two days after the Declaration of Independence, and four days after the Lee Resolution, meaning that there would be no returning to the British Empire.

Title: Olive Branch Petition
Description: Soon after the war broke out, most Congressmen hoped to repair relations with Great Britain, instead of declaring independence. So in a last-ditch attempt to end the war before it got out of hand, Congress drafted the Olive Branch Petition, asking King George III to get rid of the taxes the colonists didn't like and improve relations. However, King George didn't even read it, declaring the colonists to be traitors, and the war continued.

Title: Fort Gower Resolutions
Description: A declaration made by Virginian colonists that fought in Lord Dunmore's War made directly after the conflict. The men had just received word of the First Continental Congress' organized boycott against British goods to protest the Intolerable, an act of defiance against the Empire. Delighted by this turn of events, the soldiers gathered at Fort Gower in Ohio and wrote a series of resolves, which included a declaration that the Virginians were prepared to respond with force against Great Britain if their rights continued to be infringed. This was the first vocal declaration of such threat of rebellion, written six months before the first shots of the Revolutionary War were fired.

Title: Lord Dunmore's Proclamation
Description: A decree signed by John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, royal governor of the British Colony of Virginia. It promised emancipation to any American slaves willing to run away and join the British Army. 80,000 to 100,000 slaves ran away from their masters (including both Patriots and Loyalists), including 17 of Washington's own over the length of the war. American reactions were mixed; Virginia declared on December 14 that runaway slaves would be immediately executed, while General Washington issued a counter to the proclamation, promising freedom to any slaves that enlisted in the Continental Army or state militias. These slaves would serve in racially integrated units, which would not be seen again in America for over 150 years. Rhode Island, with the highest proportion of slaves in its population in New England, formed a black regiment giving the promise of freedom. The South, minus South Carolina and Georgia, followed suit, giving freedom to many blacks after the war (though not all).

Title: <i>Thoughts on Government</i>
Description: A paper written by John Adams in which he outlines how he thinks state governments ought to be structured. He explained the benefits of a three-branch system of government, consisting of a legislative, executive, and judicial branch, all with checks and balances over each other. He also expressed the importance of a bicameral legislature. One example he examined was the Constitution of Pennsylvania, whose legislature was unicameral. The state claimed that its people had one set of interests, but Adams disagreed, saying that having two houses was the best solution to the natural divide between the aristocracy (represented in the upper house) and the ordinary people (who would occupy the lower). A powerful governor and court system would also be necessary to balance out the powers of the legislature. Every state but Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Georgia established a bicameral legislature, but only Massachusetts gave their governor veto power, as most of the country had bad experiences with royally appointed governors abusing their power over the elected assemblies.

Title: <i>Common Sense</i>
Description: <i>Common Sense</i> was a pamphlet written by Thomas Paine advocating for independence from Great Britain. Paine wrote about the flaws in a monarchical government, complained that the English constitution was borne out of tyrannies of the king and aristocracy, and affirmed that honesty and good moral character is worth more than "crowned ruffians." Paine assured readers that if they remained colonies, their economy would be forever tied down by the Navigation Acts, but could flourish on its own. Americans could stay out of the many wars fought by Great Britain against other European powers, and most grandiosely of all, become a haven for freedom, a savior of mankind.

It was written in layman's terms, and although not everyone could read, those who could read it to everyone else. <i>Common Sense</i> was directed towards everybody, not just the elite, in an effort to include the number of people thinking about politics. It soon became the most widely read book in America (percentage-wise) and sold more than 150,000 copies. It dramatically changed how Americans saw the war, as, before the book, most hoped to eventually repair relations with Great Britain. Instead, they desired to form a new republic, and less than five months later the Declaration of Independence was ratified.

Title: <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>
Description: <i>An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations</i> was a book written by Adam Smith in which he examined what makes nations prosperous. In it, he discredits the prevailing economic theory of mercantilism. Under this system, countries operated under the belief that there was a finite amount of wealth in the world, and so the more prosperous one's neighbors were, the worse off one's own country was. Wealth was amassed by minimizing imports and maximizing exports, as well as frequent piracy. Smith criticizes mercantilism for equating precious metals like gold and silver with wealth, instead arguing that a nation's wealth is better measured by the amount of goods and services it can output. This was the advent of the concept of gross domestic product (GDP), which is still used today to evaluate the prosperity of a country. He argues that gold and silver should not be hoarded, but kept in circulation, as that would keep more money flowing throughout the economy, which leads to more production, which leads to more wealth. Smith also advocated for little government intervention into the economy, claiming that in a totally free market, would be self-regulating. This idea was named "the invisible hand of the free market" and is another central idea to capitalism, the economic system that Smith vouches for in his book. Mercantilism soon fell out of favor among most countries and would adopt capitalism in its place, including the United States, a country that would become its primary defender during the Cold War.

Description: A resolution approved by the Continental Congress that declared the secession of the rebellious states from Great Britain. Named after Virginia Burgess Richard Henry Lee, who proposed the document to Congress, it was approved by every rebellious colony but New York, whose delegates had not yet been instructed by their state governments on how to vote (they voted to join the new states on July 9). Before the voting, Congress established three committees in anticipation of the resolution passing: one to write a formal declaration of independence, another to create a frame of government for the new country, and the last to draft a model treaty for foreign relations. The Declaration of Independence would be signed on July 4, two days after Congress decided to secede.

Title: <b>Declaration of Independence signed</b>
Description: A document declaring the rebellious states to become a nation independent of Great Britain named the United States of America. It was written by Thomas Jefferson and signed by the 13 states on July 4. The declaration claimed that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness," and continued with a list of ways in which Congress felt King George III of Great Britain had infringed upon those rights, how the American people had continuously protested against those infringements, and how they had been ignored. Jefferson had originally included a section condemning slavery and criticizing Great Britain for allowing it to flourish, but it was removed at South Carolina's and Georgia's urging. July 4 is celebrated as Independence Day in the US.

Title: Vermont Republic founded
Description: In 1777, a government controlled the region of Vermont that was separate from the US, Great Britain, France, or any other country. After the end of the French and Indian War, there were overlapping land claims made by both the New York and New Hampshire colonies. In response, an independent government was established declaring the region to be called the Republic of New Connecticut. They later changed the name to Vermont, based of the French name for the Green Mountain Boys, a militia from Vermont that fought for the Americans in the Revolutionary War. Their constitution banned slavery, and was based off the radical constitution of Pennsylvania. In 1781, the US announced it would recognize or annex Vermont in return for the cession of some land claims. They accepted, and the Republic of Vermont lasted for 10 more years until it was admitted as the free state counterpart to Kentucky to maintain the power balance.

Title: Articles of Confederation written
Description: The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union was the first draft for an official government of the US, coming 15 months after the new nation declared independence. It proposed a confederation of the 13 states, each with their own, mostly autonomous government. They would be united by a weak central government, similar to the Second Continental Congress. The Articles placed great emphasis on decentralized power, as the American Revolution was being fought because of a tyrannical authoritarian, something the Americans wished to avoid a repetition of. The Continental Congress was renamed to the Congress of the Confederation, but most used its old name, as the Articles changed very little of Congress' powers or responsibilities. The Articles were largely written in order to justify the actions of Congress, as when they were formed they had no legal authority to do anything, and yet they established a military, negotiated with foreign countries, issued paper currency, imposed trade restrictions, and other functions of a government. On June 12, 1776, Congress appointed a special council of 13 to create a written constitution to act as a guide for the powers of the government. The first draft was finished within a month, which was sent to Congress for revision. The final draft was approved for ratification by Congress on November 15, 1777. It consisted of a preamble, 13 articles, and a conclusion. The articles consisted of the following:

-names the confederation "The United States of America"
-promises sovereignty to each state, with the exception of the powers granted to Congress
-states the purpose of the confederation to be to protect each other
-grants people the right to move freely between states and equal rights between states
-grants each state 2-7 Congressmen appointed by state legislatures, who collectively get one vote. 
-grants Congress the exclusive right to declare war and conduct foreign political and commercial relations
-state legislatures assign ranks of colonel and below to soldiers in wartime
-each state contributes to the federal budget, proportional to the amount of money each has
-grants Congress certain powers, including making treaties and alliances, determining war and peace, establishing courts, and minting coins. Congress serves as the highest court to resolve interstate disputes. Such a court is composed of appointed commissioners. Congress regulates the post office and the military, including appointing military officers. Congress can request payment or supplies from states. Congress cannot declare wars, make treaties or alliances, or appoint a commander-in-chief without the permission of nine states.
-most powers of Congress can be exercised by states when nine of them agree when Congress is in session
-Quebec will be allowed into the confederation if they wish; otherwise, nine states must grant consent to admit new states
-the confederation accepts the Second Continental Congress' war debt
-the government is permanent and can only be altered with the permission of Congress and every state legislature

However, from their inception the Articles were fatally flawed. Congress had essentially no power without the consent of states. Many soldiers during the war defected because of a lack of pay, and Congress had no authority to force the states to pay them. Congress could also not force delegates to show up, leaving little accomplished in a timely matter. For this reason, the signing of the Treaty of Paris was delayed by several months due to a lack of delegates showing up. The Articles were ratified in 1781, and continued to serve as the country's constitution until 1788.

Title: French Treaty of Alliance, and of Amity and Commerce
Description: An alliance between France and the US, with the former agreeing to assist the latter in their fight for independence from Great Britain. France was originally neutral in the conflict. On the one hand, they still resented the British for their recent defeat in the Seven Years' War, and were eager to enact their revenge. However, that same war left them broke, leaving them cautious to engage in another war with the country that they were not sure they could win. The Battle of Saratoga in 1777 tipped the scales in the US' favor, proving to the French that the fledgling nation had a chance at winning. Negotiations were opened between the two countries, with the US using their Model Treaty to draft an agreement. The nations signed two treaties in tandem: the Treaty of Alliance, in which they agreed to defend each other from British aggression, and the Treaty of Amity and Commerce, which was a commercial alliance. The French provided much-needed support to the Americas, helping them to win the War of Independence. It was ratified by the US on May 4, and by France on July 16.

Title: Surrender at Yorktown
Description: Desperate to win the South, Cornwallis abandoned the Carolinas and moved for Yorktown, VA. Meanwhile, French troops had begun arriving in larger numbers, and they and Washington were ready for a big battle. Washington wanted to attack Clinton at New York, but the French convinced him to instead attack at Yorktown. The French sent a fleet of ships to the Chesapeake Bay led by Admiral Comte de Grasse. In the Battle of the Chesapeake on September 5, the French cleared the British Navy out of the Chesapeake. After that, the Americans and British laid siege to the city for a month before Cornwallis surrendered. More than 7000 British soldiers were captured, and was the last major battle of the war. After the defeat, support for the war in Great Britain was lost and peace negotiations began.

In return, the US agrees not to prosecute the loyalists for fighting against them. The British agreed to abandon the forts in America territory (which they ended up not doing), and ceded Florida to Spain. France did not get anything in particular. Congress ratified the treaty on January 14, 1784, while the British Parliament ratified it on April 9.

Title: <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i>
Description: A book written by Thomas Jefferson. It contained many of his most famous beliefs, such as the separation of church and state, a constitutional government with checks and balances, and individual liberty. Specifically, he affirms that the government's job is purely secular, leading to accusations of atheism by his opponents. He ardently opposes slavery, instead advocating for their emancipation and relocation to Africa. He believes that blacks and whites could not peacefully coexist in the same area, hence his deportation solution. He also writes that blacks were intellectually inferior to whites. He explores the possibilities of a large American navy, an idea that would eventually be adopted by the party of Jefferson's opponents, the Federalists. It was the only full-length book Jefferson wrote, and is often considered to be the most important book in American history before 1800.

Title: Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom
Description: A statute written by Thomas Jefferson in 1777 to promote religious tolerance. It guaranteed the freedom of religion to all, including all Christians, Jews, Muslims, and Hindus, as well as de-establishing the Church of England in Virginia. Jefferson found the merging of the church and state to be one of the primary obstacles to liberty, and so doggedly pursued the two's separation, first in Virginia, then in the federal government. He introduced the bill to the House of Burgesses in 1779, where it was bitterly debated for several years, eventually passing in 1786.

Title: Shays' Rebellion
Description: An uprising composed of indebted farmers organized by Daniel Shays. In protest of the government's economic instability, they closed down some courts in Massachusetts and attacked a debtor's prison. The central government was unable to act to put the rebellion down, and had to hire a private militia to do the job for them. The rebellion was eventually crushed, but it demonstrated the weaknesses of the Confederate government and spurred the Constitutional Convention.

Title: Great Compromise
Description: There was dispute over how to arrange Congress. James Madison proposed the Virginia Plan, which would give states delegates based on population. William Patterson proposed the New Jersey Plan, which would give all states the same number of delegates. Larger states backed the Virginia Plan, while smaller ones rallied behind the New Jersey Plan. Eventually, Roger Sherman proposed the Connecticut Compromise (or Great Compromise) that would allow both; Congress would be bicameral, with the House of Representatives (based on state population) and the Senate (2 delegates per state). This plan was eventually accepted.

Title: Three-Fifths Compromise
Description: A compromise in the US Constitution to resolve the issue of how slaves would be counted in Congress. Since it had been agreed upon in the Great Compromise that the number of members in the House of Representatives for each state would be determined by each state's population, the question arose of whether or not to count slaves (as they were considered property by the South and also could not vote). Northern delegates argued that because of that, they should not be counted in the House. The South, on the other hand, wanted slaves to count towards their total population. The main reason for both of these arguments was one of power, not morality. If slaves were counted, the South would have greater representation (and therefore more power) in the House, something the Northerners were apprehensive about. After much bitter debate, they arrived at the 3/5 Compromise, stating that slaves would be counted as 3/5 of a person for the purposes of calculating House membership. Due to the North's dislike of the words "black," "Negro," or "slave" in the Constitution, the term "other persons" was used instead. The Three-Fifths Compromise can still be found in Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution. However, this agreement became obsolete in 1865, when slavery was abolished, ending the distinction between "free persons" and "other persons."

Title: Northwest Ordinance of 1787
Description: A law passed by the Confederate Congress that created the Northwest Territory, a US-controlled region between the Great Lakes, the Mississippi River, and the Ohio River. It made plans to split the territory into three to five states (once the area reached a population of 60,000) that would have powers and representation equal to those of the original 13, which was an unusual idea at the time. This idea would create a precedent for most territories acquired by the country to become states (with the exception of some island territories like Puerto Rico). The ordinance banned slavery in the territory, as well as forbidding slavery in any state that would be created in that territory. It also set up a public university to educate the residents of the territory. Finally, the residents of the territory were guaranteed certain legal rights, a prelude to the Bill of Rights. The territory was eventually broken up into the states of Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Illinois. It is often hailed as the Confederate government's biggest achievement.

Title: Constitution written
Description: The Constitution, the second draft for the American government, was written. It featured a more powerful federal government, composed of three branches: a legislative branch (to pass laws), an executive branch (to enforce the law), and a judicial branch (to interpret the law). The legislative branch consists of Congress, composed of the House of Representatives, led by the Speaker of the House, and the Senate, led by the vice president. The executive branch is led by the president, followed by the vice president and presidential cabinet. The judicial branch is headed by the Supreme Court, followed by the Courts of Appeals, then the district courts. It featured many compromises, like the Connecticut Compromise (which organized a bicameral legislature) and the Three-Fifths Compromise (which counted slaves as 3/5 of a person when accounting for representation in the House of Representatives).

Title: Federalist Papers
Description: After the Constitution was written, the delegates mandated that at least nine of the thirteen states ratify it. To advocate for it, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay wrote a series of 85 essays called the Federalist Papers that argued the benefits of adopting the Constitution as the nation's new government. Those in favor of ratification were known as Federalists (unrelated to the later Federalist Party), and were opposed by the Anti-Federalists (led by revolutionary orator Patrick Henry), who believed the Constitution to be flawed for a number of reasons mostly about giving the federal (central) government too much power. 

One such qualm was with the Elastic Clause, granting Congress the authority to "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution ... all other Powers vested by this Constitution." Anti-Federalists feared the unlimited power granted to Congress through this clause, but Hamilton and Madison assured the people that that it would only grant the legislative branch powers already given to it through the rest of the document.

Another problem the Anti-Federalists had was the lack of a guarantee of individual rights, which they felt allowed the central government to abuse the people. While Federalists thought the separation of powers in the central government made such guarantees unnecessary, they nevertheless added a Bill of Rights to the Constitution, securing basic individual rights.

By the time all 85 essays were written, eight of the nine required states had already ratified the Constitution.

Title: <i>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano</i>
Description: <i>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Or Gustavus Vassa, The African</i> was published in England. It was an autobiography of Olaudah Equiano, an African who was kidnapped by slave traders when he was 11 years old, sometime in the mid-1750s. Equiano was brought on board a slave ship and shipped to Barbados. Shortly thereafter, he was purchased by a British sea captain who named his Gustavus Vassa. He fought as a soldier in the Seven Years' War and had enough money in 1766 to buy his way out of slavery. In his book, Equiano reminds the reader that white people were once uncivilized like the Africans, but that did not make them inferior. He asserts that all races could become more intellectual and civilized, and so Africans did not deserve to be enslaved. To support this notion, the front cover of the book is Equiano in European clothing and holding a Bible, to suggest that Africans could become civilized like Europeans. The book is the best-known first-person account of a slave in the 18th century.

Title: Election of 1789
Description: An election that placed George Washington as the 1st president. It was the first election in the country's history under the Constitution, which had only been ratified several months before the election. As such, North Carolina and Rhode Island were ineligible to vote, as they had not yet signed the Constitution. New York also refrained from voting due to being unable to select electoral delegates in time. Due to his popularity, Washington ran virtually unopposed, though there were still contenders for vice president, which the Constitution stated would be the runner-up in the election. Every delegate cast one of their two votes for Washington, guaranteeing his the presidency. John Adams received the second highest number of votes, giving him the position of vice president.

Title: Hamilton's Economic Plan
Description: A four-point plan for the US economy developed by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. He desired to turn the US into a global industrial powerhouse, and to do that he needed a strong federal government. His plan consisted of the following:

1) The federal government's assumption of all debts from the Confederate government ($52 million), as well as debts accrued by the states during the Revolutionary War ($25 million). This would build up the nation's credit with foreign countries, as well as fostering national unity. The problem was that Southern states (excluding South Carolina) had already paid off most of their debts, while the ones with the highest debts were all Northern. Southerners saw this as Hamilton favoring the North over the South and refused to pass the bill. It was passed after Hamilton and Jefferson negotiated to move the federal capital to the South in exchange.

2) Enact a tax on whiskey. Hamilton hoped this would raise money for the government and discourage Americans from drinking excessively. It went into effect in March 1791. Poor farmers objected to this tax, as many of them turned their excess grain into whiskey, which they then sold for a profit. The tax would hurt them financially even more. They grew so upset that a group of them in Pennsylvania took up arms in an event known as the Whiskey Rebellion that was suppressed by the military.

3) A tariff on manufactured goods. Hamilton predicted this would discourage purchasing these products from overseas, forcing them to buy from domestic markets. The manufacturing industry in the US would be promoted as a result, establishing a stronger economic presence. It passed on July 4, 1789.

4) The charter of a Bank of the United States. This would be a private, profitable corporation that would act on behalf of the federal government. The National Bank would store the federal government's money and print a national currency to be used by every state. It would have a 20-year charter, and would have certain restrictions placed on it to dissuade corruption, such as preventing it from purchasing government bonds. This was also highly controversial, with Southern Republicans like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison arguing that the establishment of the Bank was unconstitutional, robbed power from state banks, and served only to further the interests of the industrial North while providing no real benefit to the agrarian South. Hamilton cited the Elastic Clause as justification, claiming that it indirectly gave the government the right to create a national bank. This was an example of loose construction, the view that the Constitution granted the federal government powers not explicitly stated. The charter passed on February 25, 1791.

Title: Compromise of 1790
Description: A deal between Alexander Hamilton of the Federalist Party and James Madison and Thomas Jefferson of the Democratic-Republican Party. After Hamilton's Economic Plan was proposed, the Federalists were unable to get it passed (specifically, the act of the federal government assuming all state debts). The three met together over dinner to discuss terms for its passage. They decided to pass the Funding Act of 1790 (which did as Hamilton wanted), but was packaged along with the Residence Act, which mandated that a permanent national capital be established along the Potomac River. This capital was eventually determined to be the Washington District of Columbia (Washington DC), located on the border of Maryland and Virginia, two pro-slavery states. Hamilton agreed to this plan because he figured the more important capital of the country would not be the political one, but the economic one, ie New York City. He correctly predicted that NYC would be the thriving economic center of the Union throughout its existence.

Title: Whiskey Rebellion
Description: A rebellion by Western Pennsylvanian farmers in protest of the 1791 whiskey tax. Alexander Hamilton had orchestrated the passage of the text in order to promote revenue for the federal government and discourage Americans from drinking too much hard liquor. However, poor farmers depended on the sale of whiskey (which they converted from the grain they grew). They argued that Hamilton had essentially placed an income tax exclusively on farmers, as wealthy Easterners were barely affected by it. They became so upset that a group of them took up arms in protest. Many of them were war veterans that believed they were protesting for the same values as in the American Revolution, specifically no taxation without representation. Hamilton and other proponents of the tax countered by claiming that they did have representation in the government directly through the House of Representatives, who approved the tax. Nevertheless, the farmers began attacking federal officials attempting to collect the tax. In July 1794, 500 armed farmers under the command of Major James McFarlane attacked the home of tax inspector General John Neville. President Washington, determined to put down the rebellion, sent both peace negotiators and a militia force of 13,000 to Pennsylvania. Washington himself led the force partway, making him the only president in US history to have led armed forces while in office. The militia force didn't arrive in time, as the rebels had already dispersed, resulting in no confrontation. 20 people were arrested, but all charges were dropped. The whiskey tax, however, remained arduous to collect, with many farmers dodging it. It was repealed in 1801 when Thomas Jefferson became president, who supported farmers and opposed Hamilton's policies. The Whiskey Rebellion can be seen as a post-Constitution counterpart to Shays' Rebellion, as both involved angry and poor farmers taking up arms against the government. The difference was that the Confederate government was unable to mobilize an armed force to suppress it, while the government under the Constitution was. This proved to the American people that having a stronger federal government was necessary to suppress the tyranny of mob rule.

3-4 Pennsylvanian rebels killed

Title: St. Clair's Defeat
Description: A battle fought in the Northwest Indian War between 1000 US soldiers and workers led by Major General Arthur St. Clair and 1100 Western Confederate warriors led by Little Turtle. The warriors ambushed the Americans, who were badly trained and not ready to fight in such conditions. The warriors thoroughly defeated the Americans, suffering only a few dozen casualties, while killing, wounding, or capturing almost all of St. Clair's men. Major General Richard Butler was one of the men killed in the engagement. It has been described as one of the US military's greatest defeats and one of the largest victories by Native Americans over a white country. However, the success would not last, as the Confederacy would surrender after their defeat at the Battle of Fallen Timbers.

Title: Bill of Rights
Description: The first ten amendments to the Constitution were ratified. It included the following:

First Amendment: Protects individual freedom of speech, the press, religion, assembly, and petition, as well as separating church from state. It was added in order to protect the rights the Founding Fathers believed to be necessary to a functioning society.

Second Amendment: Protects individual right to possess and bear firearms. It was added so that the US could keep a state-regulated militia as their main military force, instead of an organized army. It was important that the powers of the military were kept in the hands of the people, not the government.

Third Amendment: Protects against forced quartering of soldiers in civilian homes. While not used much today, it was important for civilians at the time. The 1774 Quartering Act left people feeling like their privacy was being invaded by the government. The Framers wanted to ensure that the federal government could not intimidate its people into submission or invade their privacy in this manner.

Fourth Amendment: Protects individual right against unreasonable search and seizure. It was added to ensure the government could not infringe on the people's right to privacy, provided they didn't have a good reason. However, if they could provide reason to suspect an individual of something that would warrant a search of their property, such as carrying illegal drugs or firearms, they could carry through with the procedure.

Fifth Amendment: Guarantees that the individual right to life, liberty, and property cannot be infringed without the due process of law. It was important to the Framers that people's rights be protected unless properly convicted.

Sixth Amendment: Guarantees right to fair and speedy public trial. These were important if the judicial system were to work properly.

Seventh Amendment: Guarantees right to trial by jury. This would ensure that convictions could not be made by a corrupt judge in the pocket of a corporation or the government. Instead, ordinary citizens that were randomly selected would administer the verdict, guaranteeing that there was no corruption.

Eighth Amendment: Protects individuals against cruel and unusual punishment, as well as excessive fines or bail. This was to ensure that punishments were fair, so that people could not be oppressed by the courts.

Ninth Amendment: Protects individual rights not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. This was added because not every right could be added to the Constitution, so the Founding Fathers decided to add an amendment giving people rights not not mentioned.

Tenth Amendment: Delegates all jurisdiction not explicitly stated in the Constitution to be under the federal government to be under state government. The Founding Fathers wanted the states to have a great degree of autonomy, so they were granted jurisdiction over most legislative matters. However, to ensure that the states were more unified than under the Articles of Confederation, the federal government was granted ultimate power in matters under their jurisdiction.

These were all added to satisfy the Anti-Federalists, a group of people afraid that the Constitution did not protect enough individual rights.

Alexander Chisholm, a resident of South Carolina, sued the state of Georgia over payments made to the state during the War for Independence. Georgia refused to show, claiming that it could not be sued without its consent due to its position as a state. However, the Supreme Court ruled 3-1 that federal courts had the right to hear cases between citizens and states. However, Congress disliked the ruling and facilitated the passage of the 11th Amendment, which overturned the verdict. <i>Chisholm v. Georgia</i> is often considered the first landmark Supreme Court case.

Title: Naval Act of 1794
Description: A law passed under the Washington Administration that authorized the construction of six frigates that would become the start of the US Navy. The law was passed because of the harassment and attacks made by Barbary pirates on American merchant ships, and because the US had sold their last ship by 1785. The frigates were as follows:
1) USS United States (launched May 10, 1797)
2) USS Constellation (September 9, 1797)
3) USS Constitution (October 21, 1797)
4) USS Chesapeake (December 2, 1799)
5) USS Congress (August 15, 1799)
6) USS President (April 10, 1800)

The total cost for the project was almost $700,000.

Title: Battle of Fallen Timbers
Description: The last battle in the Northwest Indian War, fought between 3000 US troops led by Generals Anthony Wayne (commander of the Legion of the United States) and Charles Scott (Kentucky militia) and ~1200 Western Confederate warriors led by Chiefs Little Turtle (Miami) and Blue Jacket (Shawnee). The Confederates were also aided by a British company of Canadian militiamen led by Captain Alexander McKillop. Wayne and his men were able to drive the warriors back with a bayonet charge, forcing them towards the British Fort Miami. However, the British in the fort denied the Confederates assistance, unwilling to fight another war with the Americans. This refusal shook Confederate confidence in the ability to defend their homeland, as they had just lost the backing of a valuable and powerful ally. Wayne handily defeated the warriors and the British withdrew from the Northwest Territory. Realizing they had lost their only chance to win the war, the Confederacy sued for peace, agreeing to sign the Treaty of Greenville, which brought the Northwest Indian War to a close. However, Tecumseh, a Shawnee who fought in the battle, was upset at the humiliation his people suffered from the treaty, and in 20 years he rallied tribes to attack the US again.

Title: Jay's Treaty
Description: A treaty drafted in Great Britain to keep the US out of the Anglo-French War that was taking place at the time. It was signed on November 19, 1795 and ratified on June 24, 1795. The US agreed to pay off debts to the British, and that the British could remove French property from US ships. In return, Great Britain had to abandon their forts in the Northwest territory (which they ended up not doing). The pro-French Democratic-Republicans were enraged that Jay gave the British such a great deal. However, the pro-British Federalists loved it, because it improved relations with Great Britain. It helped keep the US out of a war that might have destroyed it.

Title: Treaty of Greenville
Description: A treaty between the US and the Native American tribes of the Northwest Territory that ended the Northwest Indian War. It was signed at Fort Greenville in modern-day Ohio and redefined what parts of the area each party controlled. Specifically, Native Americans were to relinquish all claims in Ohio except the northwest, demarcated by the Greenville Treaty Line, though they could still hunt in the ceded land. In return, the Native Americans would be paid every year in money and cloth, and were given $20,000 for accepting the treaty. The Northwestern tribes were left unhappy with the treaty, and tension grew between them and the US as white settlers continued to encroach on the territory allotted to the tribes by the treaty, which would culminate in another war in 1810.

Title: Pinckney's Treaty
Description: A treaty between the US and Spain establishing good relations between the two nations and the border of West Florida. Its northern border was originally set at the 31st Parallel in 1763, but was changed the next year to 32° 22′ to give the colony more land. However, the US claimed the new land allotted to West Florida had been theirs first. In 1784, Spain shut off trade between the US and Louisiana until the dispute was resolved. US delegate Thomas Pinckney and Spanish delegate met in Madrid and negotiated the treaty. Spain agreed to cede their claims to the extended border of West Florida, formally setting the colony's northern border to be at the 31st parallel north between the Chattahoochee River in the East and the Mississippi River in the West. It also established the western boundary of the United States at the Spanish colony of Louisiana. The US and Spain agreed not to incite Native American attacks on each other and instead protect each other's ships and establish good trade relations. It was ratified by the US on March 7, 1796, and by Spain on April 25, 1796.

Title: Election of 1796
Description: An election in which Federalist John Adams beat Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson and became the 2nd president. This was the first contested election, as incumbent George Washington had decided not to run for a third term. It was the first true test to see if the republican voting system worked, as well as the first in which political parties played a major role. Federalists supported Vice President John Adams, while Democratic-Republicans rallied around former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. The campaign was filled with bitter insults and accusations. Federalists accused the Republicans of supporting the French government, which was executing large numbers of people unjustifiably. Republicans linked Adams to the policies of Alexander Hamilton, another Federalist known for his pro-British sentiments and support for a powerful federal government. They also connected Adams to John Jay, another Federalist responsible for signing Jan eponymous treaty, which Republicans were upset was too good a deal with the British. Adams ran with former South Carolina Governor Thomas Pinckney as his running mate, while Jefferson picked New York Senator Aaron Burr. Adams was elected president, netting 71 electoral votes, one more than the 70 required to win. However, some delegates who voted for Adams cast their second vote for candidates besides Pinckney, resulting in Jefferson coming in second place and winning the vice presidency.

Title: Quasi-War
Description: An undeclared war fought almost entirely at sea between the US and France, Caused because the US refused to pay debts to France for assisting in the Revolution, claiming it was owed to a previous regime. France was also upset about Jay's Treaty, claiming that they would rather help an old enemy than an old ally. A two year series of naval skirmishes ensued. Adams, desperate for the conflict not to escalate, rejects his party's anti-French ideals and opened negotiations with the European nation. Crying treason, many Federalists withdrew support for Adams, contributing to his loss at re-election.

Title: Alien and Sedition Acts
Description: A series of laws passed under the Adams Administration that were ostensibly to protect national security during the Quasi-War. They consisted of the following:

1) Naturalization Act (June 18): Extended the period of time foreigners had to be present in the US to gain citizenship from 5 to 14 years.
2) Alien Friends Act (July 8): Allowed the president to deport or imprison foreigners that were considered "dangerous."
3) Alien Enemies Act (July 8): Allowed the president to deport or imprison any male citizen of a hostile nation above the age of 14 during wartime.
4) Sedition Act (July 14): Allowed the prosecution of statements critical of the government.

The laws were likely passed to suppress Adams' political opponents. Immigrants typically became Democratic-Republicans, so if it was more difficult for them to become a citizen or stay in the country, it would be more difficult for them to vote against Adams. The Sedition Act was mostly used to imprison the Democratic-Republicans that criticized Adams. Republicans argued that these laws, especially the Sedition Act, unconstitutionally suppressed the freedom of the press. Thomas Jefferson and James Madison authored the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions in protest, which claimed that the laws violated the people's liberties. The acts were actually used quite sparingly, with only 26 people arrested under the Sedition Act, and no foreigners being deported under the Alien Friends Act. However, they lost support for the Federalist Party, contributing to Jefferson's victory in the 1800 election. The acts expired in 1801 except for the Alien Enemies Act, which remains in effect to this day. The acts show how in early America, how free speech should be was still a matter of debate.

Title: Election of 1800
Description: An election in which Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson beat incumbent Federalist John Adams and became the 3rd president. Referred to as the Revolution of 1800, the campaign was fraught with more insults and accusations. The Federalists warned that the Democratic-Republicans would ruin the country with their radical and pro-French policies. The Republicans countered by bringing up the Alien and Sedition Acts, claiming that Adams was unconstitutionally suppressing the freedom of the press, as well as claiming the Federalists supported the despotic British who the country had just fought a devastating war with. 

Alexander Hamilton, head of the Federalist Party, had originally had hopes of influence in the Adams Administration. However, after the Election of 1796 he found that Adams was more independent than he would have liked. To make sure he still had influence in the government, Hamilton put his support behind the more partisan Charles C. Pinckney, who became Adams' running mate. Hamilton's plan backfired when Republican press got hold of a letter he wrote criticizing Adams, which lost support for himself, Adams, and the Federalist Party. Jefferson, meanwhile, chose to run with Aaron Burr again. When the votes were cast, Jefferson and Burr took the lead, but there was a problem. Each electoral delegate was allotted two votes, which were meant to be used for a presidential candidate and his respective running mate, but in reality either could be used for anyone. One delegate was supposed to throw away one of his votes which would ensure that the presidential candidate always got at least one more vote than his running mate. For example, one Federalist delegate voted for Adams, but cast his second vote for John Jay, a Federalist who was not even running. This ensured that Pinckney got at least one vote less than Adams. However, the designated delegate for the Democratic-Republicans failed to do so, creating a tie between Jefferson and Burr. In these circumstances, it was up to the Federalist-controlled House of Representatives to break the tie, with each state being allowed to cast one vote. All seven Republican-controlled delegations voted for Jefferson, in addition to the Federalist-controlled Georgian delegation. Six Federalist-controlled delegations voted for Burr, and Vermont and Maryland were unable to come to a consensus, forcing them to cast a blank ballot. This left Jefferson with eight states to Burr's six, but neither had the nine necessary for a majority. The ballots were cast 34 more times, each resulting in the same number of states for each candidate. Finally, Hamilton intervened. He despised Jefferson's viewpoints, but saw him as the lesser of two evils. In the 36th ballot, he instructed his Federalist allies in the Maryland and Vermont delegations not to vote, giving the vote in both states to Jefferson, netting him the presidency. 

The election was viewed as a constitutional crisis. The government decided that an incident like that ought not to happen again, and so worked to pass the 12th Amendment, which resolved the issue by requiring the two votes of each delegate to be for a presidential and vice presidential candidate, respectively. This would eliminate the "throwing away votes" pseudo-rule implemented before.

When Adams' term expired, he peacefully stepped down and allowed the opposition party to take power. This was an important step for the fledgling republic, whose integrity is tested most when the party in power is voted out. Adams stepped down instead of remaining in office and mobilizing the military to take out the opposition leaders. The election results established a precedent for the party in power peacefully giving up when they are not re-elected.

Title: First Barbary War
Description: The Barbary States of Tripoli, Algiers, and Tunis in North Africa frequently engaged in pirate raids of ships that sailed into their waters. They kidnapped the sailors and enslaved them if a ransom was not paid for their return. When American sailors were kidnapped, the US refused to pay and Tripoli declared war. This was the first US war that took place on foreign soil. In 1805, US troops captured the Tripolitan city of Derna, marking the first time the US flag was raised in a foreign city in a military victory.

Casualties: 
74 Americans
~800 Tripolitans

Title: <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>
Description: A landmark Supreme Court case under Chief Justice John Marshall that established the Supreme Court's power of judicial review over federal laws. The conflict stemmed from the 1800 election, after which John Adams appointed several dozen loyal Federalists to judicial positions so his party could remain in power. The Senate quickly confirmed them, but were unable to get to all of them by the time Thomas Jefferson assumed office, leaving dispute over their validity. One of these was William Marbury, who filed a lawsuit against Jeffersonian Secretary of State James Madison, who had been instructed by Jefferson not to deliver Marbury's commission. The Court ended up ruling in Marbury's favor, but in the process struck a permanent blow to the Jeffersonians that favored weak central governments by assuming the power of judicial review, or the ability to review and strike down laws that do not comply by the Constitution.

Title: Louisiana Purchase
Description: A land deal between the US and France. In the early 17th century, the French took control of Haiti, an island colony in the Caribbean. There, they grew sugar nearly exclusively, as it was the most profitable crop that could be grown there at the time. However, the island was producing little of its own food, meaning that it had to be imported. In the early 18th century the French established New Orleans in modern-day southern Louisiana for the purpose of supplying Haiti with food. The Haitians revolted in 1791, and French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte realized that they were on the cusp of losing the colony. Therefore, Louisiana stood to be of little further value to France. 

In 1803, they offered to sell all of Louisiana Territory (828,000 square miles) to the colony's neighbor, the US, for very little money ($15 million in 1803 dollars, $600 billion in 2017 dollars). The deal worked out to be around $18.11 per square mile in 1803, or around $566 dollars per square mile in 2015 dollars. US President Thomas Jefferson had mixed feelings about the deal. He was a strict constructionist, meaning that he believed the government should not exercise any powers not explicitly delegated to them in the Constitution. Purchasing land was not an explicit right of the federal government, and Jefferson feared making the deal would be hypocritical. 

On the other hand, such a great deal was difficult to refuse. The US had had its eye on New Orleans for decades, and Jefferson figured that purchasing so much western land would allow his vision of an "empire of liberty" to flourish. That is, Jefferson viewed freedom as yeoman farmers working their own land and not having to answer to a master. Having so much land that was empty (at least, until the Native Americans were relocated) would allow ample room for everyone to have their own farm. Jefferson sidestepped the constitutionality issue by framing the deal as a treaty with a foreign government, which the Constitution explicitly gave the government the right to do. The purchase nearly doubled the size of the US, making it the largest territorial gain in the nation's history. 

Public reactions to the purchase were mixed. One newspaper wrote, "we are to give money, of which we have too little, for land, of which we already have too much." However, most were enthusiastic when they realized they could have more land all to themselves (which was especially important when property ownership was a requirement for suffrage). There was also debate over what to do with the 60,000 French inhabitants of Louisiana, almost half of whom were former slaves. However, Napoleon insisted that all of them be granted US citizenship as part of the treaty. Unfortunately for Jefferson's vision, the Louisiana Purchase provided more territory for slavery to expand into, ruining his "empire of liberty." The Louisiana Purchase, along with the invention of the cotton gin, were the two major causes for the expansion of slavery throughout the 19th century. 

The land was mostly unexplored by the US, so Jefferson sent explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to chart it. The deal was not immediately helpful, as neither the British nor the Spanish nor the Native Americans living there recognized the treaty. Nevertheless, the land would come to be seen by all as American.

Title: Lewis and Clark Expedition
Description: Officially known as the Corps of Discovery Expedition, it was an exploration of the newly purchased Louisiana Territory organized by President Jefferson. The Corps of Discovery was a group of soldiers headed by Captain Meriwether Lewis and Second Lieutenant William Clark. They were tasked with exploring the new territory, establishing an American presence there, and finding a practical route to the Pacific Ocean as their primary goals. The Corps also took notes of the area's geography, flora, and fauna, and established relations with local Native American tribes. They started in Pittsburgh, PA on May 14, 1804, and traveled across the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers until they arrived at the Missouri River, which would take them through the territory. In November, they met Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who acted as their interpreter with other Native Americans. The group established Fort Mandan in present-day North Dakota in December 1805, and reached the Pacific Ocean on November 20, 1805. They camped there for the winter and returned to St. Louis in modern-day Missouri to report their findings. Overall, they charted 140 maps, established relations with 70 tribes, and discovered over 200 new species of plants and animals.

Title: Twelfth Amendment
Description: The 12th amendment to the Constitution is ratified, which changed the electoral college to avoid deadlocks. Under the old rules, electoral delegates received two votes, which they were meant to use to cast for a candidate and their running mate. One of the delegates was supposed to throw away one of their votes to ensure that the vice presidential candidate received one less vote, making them vice president as intended. However, in the 1800 election, the intended delegate did not comply, meaning that an equal number of votes had been cast for Thomas Jefferson and his running mate Aaron Burr. The 12th Amendment fixed this by assigning each delegate two votes, with one that has to be cast for a presidential candidate and the other for a vice presidential candidate. Whoever receives a majority of the presidential electoral vote becomes president, and whoever receives the majority of the vice presidential vote becomes vice president. 

If no presidential candidate receives a majority, the victor is determined by the House of Representatives, who may only select between the top three candidates. However, instead of each representative voting individually, each state only gets one elector, in a manner similar to that of the Senate. This is to prevent candidates from populous states from having an unfair advantage, as electors tend to favor a candidate from their home state. If the House cannot come to a decision by March 4 of the year after the election, the newly elected vice president will act as president in the meantime. Similarly, if no vice presidential candidate wins a majority, the Senate will choose the victor between the top two candidates.

Additionally, the amendment prevents anyone who could not constitutionally become president from becoming vice president. Finally, electors cannot cast their vote for two people of the same state, to prevent them from favoritism.

Title: Burr-Hamilton Duel
Description: A duel in which Vice President Aaron Burr shot and killed former Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton.

Hamilton, a Federalist, and Burr, a Democratic-Republican, were never on the best terms. Their relationship turned especially sour when Hamilton cast his support for Thomas Jefferson instead of Burr for president in the 1800 election. Hamilton viewed Jefferson as the lesser of two evils, and called Burr a "mischievous enemy." His support was the deciding factor in Jefferson's win, with Burr only scoring vice president. Hamilton struck Burr down again in 1804, where he greatly assisted Morgan Lewis in winning the election as Governor of New York, a position for which Burr was also running.

Their hostilities culminated with a letter published by Charles D. Cooper of the Albany Press showing Hamilton's hostilities toward Burr. The vice president demanded an apology from Hamilton and challenged him to a duel when he received none. Both participants, placing their honor in high regard, would not back down. It was confirmed that both Hamilton and Burr fired, with the former missing (allegedly on purpose) and the latter hitting. The shot mortally wounded Hamilton, who died the next day.

The duel heavily damaged Burr's political career. He did not run with Jefferson in the 1804 election, instead being replaced by George Clinton. He was charged with murder, as the practice of dueling was in the process of being outlawed in the North, but he was never brought to court. He fled to South Carolina but soon returned to the capital to continue to serve as vice president for the remainder of his term.

Title: Election of 1804
Description: An election in which incumbent Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson was re-elected, beating Federalist candidate and NY Governor Charles C. Pinckney. John Adams had declined to run again, leaving the Federalists with his former running mate. Jefferson was nominated by his party without opposition. Though winning the 1800 Election by the slimmest of margins, Jefferson won by a landslide thanks to the Louisiana Purchase and a healthy economy. He ran with George Clinton, hoping to distance himself from his former vice president, Aaron Burr, who had recently killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. The Federalists had been devastated by this loss, as Hamilton had been their party leader. They hurled more insults and accusations at Jefferson, much like what had been done in the last two elections. They claimed the Louisiana Purchase was unconstitutional (indeed, Jefferson had worried the same thing at the time) and accused Jefferson of sleeping with his slave, Sally Hemmings, but none of it stuck. Jefferson won every state but Connecticut and Delaware, even taking most of New England, traditionally a Federalist stronghold.

Title: Burr arrested for treason
Description: Aaron Burr was arrested for treason against the United States, but was acquitted.

In 1804, after the Hamilton duel, Burr made contact with British minister Anthony Merry, where he proposed to assist Great Britain in taking western land from the US. Though Great Britain rejected the offer, Burr continued to gather support for his quest, including General James Wilkinson, the highest ranking officer in the US Army. In August 1806, Burr allegedly sent Wilkinson a letter, which the general used to betray Burr. He sent President Jefferson the letter as a warning that Burr was conspiring against the government. Jefferson sent militiamen to raid his outpost and many of Burr's volunteers abandoned him. Burr was captured in Alabama and arrested for treason. Though the accusations against Burr were often vague or contradictory, everyone maintained he was the ringleader. Additionally, there was no consensus on what Burr was planning, as Burr himself told people varying stories, while others still suspected he had other goals in mind.
Burr's lawyers proved that the letter Wilkinson provided was falsified, and anyway Burr's crime didn't meet the constitutional requirements for treason. There was no evidence that he had taken up arms against the US government.

Title: Election of 1808
Description: An election in which Democratic-Republican James Madison beat Federalist Charles C. Pinckney and became the 4th president. Jefferson endorsed Madison, his secretary of state, securing his nomination, while the Federalists ran Pinckney again. The Republicans suffered criticism of the Embargo Act of 1807, a ban on trade with Europe passed by the Jefferson Administration. This hurt New England disproportionately, which was a traditional Federalist stronghold. Nevertheless, Jefferson was still popular among most Americans, allowing Madison to handily defeat Pinckney. Notably, some of the New York delegates voted for Clinton for president, despite him running for vice president.

Title: <i>Fletcher v. Peck</i>
Description: A landmark Supreme Court case in which the Court granted itself the power of judicial review over state laws. The actual case revolved around the Yazoo land claimed by Georgia (modern-day Mississippi and Alabama). A land act was revealed to be fraudulent, and was nullified by the next politicians that assumed Georgian office. While the land act was still in effect, speculator Robert Fletcher purchased land from fellow speculator John Peck. Fletcher filed a lawsuit, claiming Peck didn't have rights to the land when he sold it. In a 9-0 vote, the Marshall Supreme Court ruled that the contract could not be repealed, even if it was created through fraud. Through this, the Supreme Court granted themselves the power to uphold or nullify the laws of states based on their constitutionality, known as judicial review. This power had been expanded through this case from just over federal laws, granted in <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>.

Title: Tecumseh's War
Description: A conflict between the US and a Native American confederacy led by the Shawnee leader Tecumseh. It started with the negotiation of the Treaty of Fort Wayne, conducted between William Henry Harrison and several Native American tribes. They eventually agreed to sell Native American land in Indiana Territory in exchange for money. Tecumseh, not present at the treaty, was outraged and insisted the treaty was illegitimate. In August 1810, Tecumseh and 400 warriors marched to meet with Harrison, insisting they not sell the land. Harrison told him the tribes could sell their own land if they wished. Tecumseh proceeded to gather support for his confederacy. The war climaxed with the Battle of Tippecanoe, a resounding defeat for Tecumseh's confederacy. Later, he allied with the British in the War of 1812, fighting to defend Canada to secure Native American rights until his death at the Battle of the Thames in 1813.

Title: Battle of Tippecanoe
Description: The largest battle in Tecumseh's War, fought while Tecumseh was away collecting recruits. Governor William Henry Harrison had marched his 1000 troops to Prophetstown, where the confederacy base was located. The confederate army was temporarily headed by Tecumseh's brother Tenskwatawa ("The Prophet"), a spiritual but not military leader. Harrison planned to negotiate with Tenskwatawa, but instead the Native American forces attacked Harrison's army, who successfully repelled them and forced them to abandon Prophetstown. They then burned the town to the ground. A crushing 
defeat for the confederacy, Harrison earned his nickname "Tippecanoe" and Tenskwatawa lost the respect of his brother. The British was blamed for the conflict because they had been supplying Tecumseh's troops, and so was one of the causes of the War of 1812.

Title: War of 1812
Description: A war between the US and the UK over land disputes and impressment of American sailors and skirmishes in the Northwest territory due to British forts. The British allied with Native American tribes like Tecumseh's Confederacy, sparking numerous Native American wars with the Americans. Remaining Native American power was broken. War ended in a draw. Officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814, but it took a month for news to reach the US, so fighting continued until February 16, 1815, when it was ratified. This marks the first time the US formally declared war on another country. It is the seventh deadliest war in American history.

Title: <i>Constitution</i> vs <i>Guerriere</i>
Description: A naval battle between the USS Constitution and the HMS Guerriere as part of the War of 1812. The Constitution, a much larger and more well-armed ship, outmatched the Guerriere and defeated it. After the first cannonball fired at the Constitution failed to inflict any damage, one of its crew members claimed its sides were made of iron, giving the ship the nickname "Old Ironsides." The loss was fairly inconsequential for the British, but it proved to be a huge rallying point for the Americans in terms of war morale. The public became energized in a spirit of nationalism, believing their modestly sized navy had crushed the all-powerful Royal Navy in a fair fight.

Title: Election of 1812
Description: An election in which incumbent Democratic-Republican James Madison was re-elected, defeating Federalist DeWitt Clinton. Northern Republicans wanted someone other than a Virginian to be their nominee, so they rallied first behind Vice President George Clinton, then his nephew DeWitt. The schism grew when the New York caucus nearly unanimously voted for Clinton for nominee, as it was filled with Republicans opposed to the new War of 1812 started by Madison. Nevertheless, Madison was elected the nominee, though not by the landslide expected from incumbents. The Federalists originally planned on running John Marshall, but with so much support for Clinton in New York they could not count on a victory there, which could result in a 3-way tie. This would put the election in the hands of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, who would surely vote in Madison. Eventually, Clinton was voted in as nominee, though there was much bitter debate and disagreement from various states, such as Virginia, who voted for Rufus King in the primaries instead. Less emphasis was put on the campaigns in this election, with the war taking the spotlight. Madison swept the South, while Clinton took New England (except for Vermont). The election came down to New York and Pennsylvania, both of which Clinton needed to win. He won in his home state of New York, but lost Pennsylvania and the presidency to Madison.

Title: Creek War
Description: A war between opposing Creek factions, the Red Sticks and the Lower Creeks. The latter was backed by local US militias, while the former was supplied by British and Spanish. As the US continued to expand west, the Creek tribe in the South began to splinter. The progressive Lower Creeks started to assimilate into Western culture, while the nativist Red Sticks resisted change, and rallied around Tecumseh. Red Sticks proceeded to attack Lower Creeks, then their conflict with white militia began on July 21 in the Battle of Burnt Corn. On August 30, 1813, the Red Sticks killed several hundred at Fort Mims in the Fort Mims Massacre, which encouraged more Americans into the war, and also soured relations with the friendly Lower Creeks. A notable commander was Colonel Andrew Jackson, who led military campaigns in Tennessee. His battalion suffered from supply shortages and low enlistment numbers, but eventually he managed to get the Red Sticks to surrender. Despite the alliance with the Lower Creeks, Jackson forced the tribe to cede 21 million acres of Creek land in Georgia and Alabama. This war helped Jackson to become a national hero, and helped him win the 1828 and 1832 elections.

Description: A British invasion of Washington DC, the US capital, as part of the War of 1812. British General Robert Ross led troops into the city and occupied it, burning down the White House and other government buildings. They remained there for just over a day (26 hours) before a sudden hurricane-level storm set in and put out the fires, as well as generating a tornado that forced the British to retreat. This marks the only time Washington DC was occupied by a foreign nation (the British had also occupied Philadelphia, then the US capital, during the American Revolutionary War).

Title: Battle of New Orleans
Description: The last major battle of the War of 1812, between US troops led by Brevet Major General Andrew Jackson and British troops led by Major General Sir Edward Pakenham. Pakenham led his troops to take New Orleans, LA, as it was a valuable supply line for the US. Jackson quickly mustered a force of 4500 men, including US soldiers, militiamen, and just regular citizens. He faced Pakenham's 8000-strong force that had just finished fighting the Napoleonic War. Jackson first attacked at night, then fell back to Rodriguez Canal, where he had his men dig the canal still deeper and use the excess dirt to make a wall, which connected a large marsh to the Mississippi River. 5000 British troops led by Colonel Robert Rennie pushed through Jackson's defensive line, but was quickly cut down along with most of his men. Meanwhile. Jackson, gleeful to exact his revenge for being imprisoned by the British during the Revolutionary War, inflicted heavy casualties on Pakenham's forces, including Pakenham himself. The British lost 3 generals and 7 colonels among their dead. 

It was a huge victory for the Americans, which elevated their national pride to unforeseen levels. They believed the war to be an American victory, though the Treaty of Ghent established it as a stalemate. Jackson became a national hero, which helped him to win the presidential election in 1828.

Title: American System
Description: The American System was proposed by President James Madison in his annual address to Congress in 1815. It was an economic plan created by Speaker of the House Henry Clay, and was heavily inspired off of Hamilton's Economic Plan from 1790. It proposed three main points:
1) A tariff on manufactured good to protect American industries
2) The charter of a Second National Bank to replace the first
3) Federal financing of a network of roads and canals

President Madison would later accept the first two, but vetoed the third on the grounds of his strict constructionist views preventing him to exercise a power not explicitly granted to him by the Constitution (which the financing of roads and canals was not covered in). However, these transportation networks were later financed at the state level.

Title: First Seminole War
Description: A conflict between the Seminole and the US in Florida. In 1814, while Great Britain was still fighting the US, they recruited some Native American tribes and gave them forts. The Seminole were uninterested in the fort, so it was given to rebel slaves, giving the fort the name "Negro Fort." Colonel Clinch sailed over and blew up the fort, killing around 300. In November 1817, Americans drove the Mikasuki out of Fowltown. A week later, Seminole attacked a ship of 50 vulnerable Americans in the Scott Massacre. In March 1818, General Jackson invaded Florida and attacked a lot of Seminole villages. He also executed a Scottish trader that was dealing arms to the Seminole and a British agent. The British considered retaliating, but the US was too valuable to their economy. The Spanish could not maintain Florida very well, so they decided to continue negotiations to sell it, leading to the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819. Congress tried to reprimand Jackson for the executions, but it didn't really work.

Title: Election of 1816
Description: An election in which Democratic-Republican James Monroe defeated Federalist Rufus King and became the 5th president. James Madison declined to run for a third term, following the precedent of Washington and Jefferson. He and Jefferson supported Monroe to become the Republican nominee, beating out William Crawford. The Federalists, who had not seen any presidents from their party since John Adams, fielded Rufus King. Monroe ran with Daniel D. Tompkins, while King selected John E. Howard as his running mate. The election was fairly one-sided; Democratic-Republicans received credit for ending the War of 1812 in a pseudo-victory, while the Federalists lost nearly all of their support after the 1814 Hartford Convention, which made them appear unpatriotic in the aftermath of the war. Madison had also implemented several key Federalist policies during his presidency, such as protective tariffs. This left the Federalists with little to campaign on to distinguish themselves from the Republicans. Indeed, not even King believed he had much of a chance of winning, and did not take the election seriously. There was a dispute in Congress over whether or not to count Indiana's votes, as they had officially become a state a few weeks after the final ballots were cast. They decided to count them, claiming that the resolution passed in late December was actually recognizing that Indian had been an official state since June of that year. Monroe swept most of the country, taking every state but Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware.

Title: Panic of 1819
Description: An economic recession caused in part by the Second National Bank. Though part of the corporation's job was to regulate the money issued by the 200 state banks, it instead invested in a speculative bubble caused by trading cotton and grain with Europe and westward expansion. As trade resumed with Europe as part of the end of the War of 1812, European demand for cotton and grain skyrocketed. At the same time, there was high demand for loans for purchasing Western land, causing both the National and state banks to print large amounts of money. When European demand for American goods inevitably went down, the demand for land went with it. Banks called in their loans, which debtors were unable to pay. Unemployment rose, pressuring the federal and state governments to relieve the stress. They responded by prevented banks from calling in their debts, which helped debtors but hurt creditors. The whole ordeal amplified the lack of trust the American people had in banks, something else that would help Andrew Jackson become president.

Title: <i>McCulloch v. Maryland</i>
Description: A Supreme Court case determining the federal government's supreme power within its jurisdiction. The Elastic Clause of the Constitution, stating that "The Congress shall have Power ... To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof," was a source of much contention between the two parties. The clause would go on to be used as justification for many an act by the federal government, such as the creation of a National Bank. In 1819, Maryland tried to impede the Bank by taxing it. The Marshall Supreme Court struck down this tax, ruling that the Elastic Clause implied the power for the federal government to create a National Bank.

Title: Missouri Compromise
Description: The Missouri Compromise was a legislative deal between the North and South to relieve sectional tensions. The area of Missouri Territory that would become the state of Missouri underwent rapid settlement in the 1810s, with thousands of Southern whites migrating with their slaves to grow hemp there (Missourian climate was not conducive to cotton, the major cash crop of most of the South).

By 1818, the area's population was reaching the threshold to petition for statehood and was expected to permit slavery. A statehood bill was introduced to Congress the next year, but was disrupted by New York Representative James Tallmadge's proposed amendment to the bill that would ban slavery in the state. The Republicans were immediately polarized by this abrupt proposal, with Northerners uniting in support of the Tallmadge Amendment and Southerners against it. The lack of party discipline during the Era of Good Feelings allowed the disunity to continue and amplify. Once united under one party, the country became torn apart over what was called the Missouri crisis.

In the 1770s and 1780s, the demand for slavery had been falling in the South. Some in the region began calling for its eventual repeal, arguing that it was antithetical to the ideals espoused in the Declaration of Independence. However, the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 saved the institution from dying out, and the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 allowed the practice to spread across the continent. The Missouri crisis united Southerners in opposition to Northern interference in Southern slavery, believing it to encourage slave revolts, which were a grave danger to white Southerners' security.

Northerners, on the other hand, were tired of the South's disproportionate amount of influence in Congress due to the 3/5 Compromise, which boosted their numbers in the House of Representatives based on the number of slaves the states had. Federalists, such as Senator Rufus King of New York, had long since been opposed to the "federal ratio" of the House, and along with Tallmadge and other Northerners, they were determined to diminish the South's perceived undue influence over politics through the Tallmadge Amendment. Southern Republicans, including President James Monroe and former President Thomas Jefferson, worried that the Tallmadge Amendment was actually a ploy by former Federalists, especially King, to establish an abolitionist party in the North and impose monarchy on the country, though this concern was mostly unfounded.

Both sides used the Constitution to support their arguments. Northerners claimed that the federal government had the right to impose restrictions on territories that would carry into their statehood, pointing to the free states of Indiana and Illinois as examples. Both states kept the restriction from when they were a part of the Northwest Territory, which the Congress of the Confederation had blocked from keeping slaves in 1787. Southerners disagreed, saying that the Northwest Territory comparison was invalid because the territory was formed under a different government, not the Constitution. The current government, they argued, granted states the right to permit or abolish slavery as they saw fit, without input from the federal government. Southerners brought up the Louisiana Purchase, which granted Louisiana Territory (the old name for Missouri Territory) residents the rights of US citizens, including the protection of property (under which slaves were included). The moral side of slavery was not very heavily discussed at the time.

The House bitterly debated the bill in mid-February of 1819. Despite the 3/5 Compromise, the superior raw population of the North allowed the Tallmadge Amendment to pass the House. However, the North held signficantly less sway in the Senate. According to the Constitution, every state received an equal number of senators regardless of population, which benefited the less populated South. That combined with the fact that the number of slave and free states were equal meant that the North did not have nearly as much power in the upper house. With the support of a few Northerners, the Senate rejected the Tallmadge Amendment. NY Representative John W. Taylor, who had previously ardently supported the Tallmadge Amendment, proposed another amendment that would amit Missouri as a slave state. Northerners objected, saying that a higher number of slave states, combined with the 3/5 Compromise, would put the North at a significant disadvantage politically. However, at around the same time as the Missouri crisis, the District of Maine, at the time a noncontiguous section of Massachusetts, began petitioning for statehood as a free state. The Senate connected the two proposals, passing a bill admitting Maine as a free state and allowing Missouri to form a constitution. An additional proposal, and the most important part of the Missouri Compromise, was introduced by Illinois Senator Jesse Thomas, banning slavery in the Louisiana Territory above the N 36°30' parallel (the southern boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of Missouri. The Missouri Compromise narrowly passed both the Senate and House, putting the main issue to rest for the moment.

When Missouri drafted its constitution, it permitted slavery and included an "exclusionary clause", which was a ban on free blacks and mulattoes from the state. This clause renewed debates over Missouri's admission as a state. Through the influence of Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, who would be known as "the Great Compromiser", the constitution was eventually confirmed, though with the condition that the exclusionary clause could not be used to abridge the rights and immunities of any US citizen, which is sometimes known as the Second Missouri Compromise. The compromise passed both houses and was signed by President Monroe on March 6, 1820.

Americans would later celebrate the Missouri Compromise as being as essential and respected as the Constitution. It helped to ease sectional tensions, ironically at the same time literally dividing the nation in two. Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter that this division would eventually lead to the dissolution of the Union (which it did forty years later). To avoid the balance of power issue again, Congress implicitly agreed to admit one free and one slave state at around the same time to maintain balance. The Compromise was integral to statehood admissions in the coming decades, but was functionally repealed in the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 and declared unconstitutional in the Dred Scott Decision of 1857, causing outrage among Northerners.

Title: Election of 1820
Description: An election in which incumbent Democratic-Republican James Monroe won re-election unopposed. The election took place during the Era of Good Feelings, during which there was only one dominant political party, the Republicans. Monroe once again ran with Daniel D. Tompkins. Due to his lack of opposition, Monroe carried every state, with a near-unanimous victory. The lone dissenter was William Plumer, a faithless elector from New Hampshire, who voted for John Quincy Adams. He believed Adams to be a better president, but a legend emerged that he dissented in order to keep George Washington as the only president to be elected unanimously. Notably, one elector each from Mississippi, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee died before the election, costing those states a vote each.

Title: Election of 1824
Description: This election placed Democratic-Republican John Quincy Adams as the 6th president over his opponents, Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay. John C. Calhoun also ran early in the election, but dropped out to successfully run for vice president. Crawford was the official Republican nominee, but it was disregarded by the other candidates. Monroe's vice president, Daniel D. Tompkins, declined to run based on his lack of popularity and health issues. When all the ballots were cast, Jackson was determined to have won a plurality of both the popular and electoral vote, but no one won a majority. Under those circumstances, it was up to the House of Representatives to decide the new president between the top three candidates. This discounted Clay, even though he would have had a strong chance of being elected in Congress if he was eligible. Before the vote, Clay was invited to Adams' house for a private meeting, raising suspicion as to what they may have discussed, especially among Jackson. After that, the House voted, determining Adams to be the winner, receiving 13 votes to Jackson's 7 and Crawford's 4. The president-elect then proceeded to appoint Clay to be Secretary of State, often considered a stepping stone for the presidency. Jackson was furious, claiming that Adams and Clay had conspired in their secret meeting to strike a "corrupt bargain" to win the presidency. He said that Clay lent his support to Adams to secure him the presidency, who would then give Clay a powerful position that he could use to attain the office later. Jackson believed he was the rightful winner of the election, as he had received more popular and electoral votes than any other candidate. He resigned his Senate seat in protest and formed his own political party, the Democrats. He would use this "corrupt bargain" theory in the 1828 election to discredit Adams and bolster his own support immensely.

Title: Second American Party System
Description: The Second American Party System consisted of the Democratic Party (headed by Andrew Jackson) and the Whig Party (headed by Henry Clay, supported by John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster). The two parties formed over a split in the Democratic-Republican Party. Andrew Jackson, enraged by the results of the 1824 election, broke off from the party and formed the Democratic Party. His opponents formed the National Republican Party as an antithesis to Jackson and soon merged with the Anti-Masons to form the Whig Party. The Whigs got their name from the British party of the same name, who supported the Parliament over the monarch. Clay called his party the Whigs because he believed Jackson acted like a (tyrannical) king during his presidency, such as by making frequent use of his veto power. The system lasted until 1854 when the Whigs broke apart due to the issue of slavery. Both parties were fairly equal in Congress, but the Whigs only got two presidents elected, both of whom died in office in their first term. People started to become more partisan during this period, as well as frequently turning up in elections, with the period seeing averages of 70-80% voter turnout starting in 1840.

Title: Election of 1828
Description: An election in which Tennessee Democrat Andrew Jackson defeated incumbent Massachusetts National Republican John Quincy Adams and became the 7th president. Fuming after his defeat in the 1824 election, Jackson formed his own party, the Democrats. Meanwhile, Adams, along with Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, formed the National Republican Party to counter Jackson. Despite John C. Calhoun being Adams' vice president, he decided to run under the Democratic Party with Jackson instead, leaving Adams to run with Richard Rush. Despite his victory in the previous election, Adams was hampered in 1828 by the Tariff of Abominations abhorred by the South. Jackson used this against Adams to gather overwhelming support from the region. Like many prior elections, this one was filled with insults and accusations. Adams' supporters accused Andrew and Rachel Jackson's marriage to be illegitimate, a topic the nominee was highly sensitive about, even previously dueling another man over it. Rachel Jackson, already suffering from a weak heart, died soon after the election, leading Andrew Jackson to blame the National Republicans for contributing to her death with their constant slander. Adams, a strong abolitionist, criticized Jackson for partaking in the slave trade. A notable difference between the two candidates was that Adams focused on his opinion on particular issues, while Jackson ran on his personality, history as a war hero, and opposition to Adams. Thomas Jefferson endorsed Jackson, adding to his popularity. Adams, popular in New England, swept the area, along with Maryland, New Jersey, and Delaware. Jackson carried the South and West, along with the key states of Pennsylvania and most of New York, securing his victory. Described as the Revolution of 1828, it was seen by many as an end to the aristocracy in power. Jackson came from humble origins, while Adams was the latest in a long line of elites. Because of he was a "common man," Jackson pledged to remove the property qualification for voting, ushering in an era of universal white male suffrage, an important milestone in American democracy. Jackson also used his "corrupt bargain" theory against Adams during the campaign, and when he won, it was seen as Americans starting to hold corruption in politics accountable.

Title: <i>The Liberator</i>
Description: The first edition of the American abolitionist newspaper "The Liberator" was written by William Lloyd Garrison and published on January 1. Though the paper did not sell incredibly well, it was still known by many due to Garrison's harsh, uncompromising attitude towards slavery. He advocated for its immediate abolition, asserting that the rights enumerated in the Declaration of Independence ought to apply to any American, regardless of race. This view was quite uncommon at the time, even in the North. Many Northerners were still opposed to abolition, and the ones who weren't generally wanted gradual emancipation. Thus, Garrison was seen as a troublesome radical. However, many Southerners believed Garrison's opinion to be that of the majority of Northerners, and consequently defended slavery more valiantly as a "positive good" and passed harsher slave laws in response. The paper continued until December 29, 1865, after slavery had been abolished in the US, meaning Garrison's goal had been accomplished.

Title: Nullification Crisis
Description: A sectional crisis involving South Carolina and the federal government. On July 14 1832, the Tariff of 1832 is passed as an effort to appease the South's anger over the Tariff of 1828 (Tariff of Abominations). South Carolina is still disgruntled, and on November 24, 1832, passes the Ordinance of Nullification, permitting the state to nullify any law passed by the federal government they see fit. They then threatened to secede if the government tried to collect on the taxes. On March 1, 1833, Congress passes the Force Bill (allowing President Jackson to use the military to force South Carolina to pay taxes) and the Tariff of 1833 (a further compromised tariff). The latter appeased the state, who repealed the Ordinance of Nullification on March 15.

Title: Whig Party founded
Description: The Whig Party is founded by Henry Clay, along with John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster. The party was composed of various anti-Democratic factions, such as the National Republicans and Anti-Masons. The party supported federal power, as well as the American System, which included tariffs and the National Bank. They were nationalist and industrialist, though supported federal financing of government projects. They believed expansion to be unnecessary. Finally, they believed the power of Congress ought to outweigh the power of the presidency. It was the first party to seriously rival the power of the Democratic Party.

Title: Second Seminole War
Description: A second conflict between the US and the Seminole tribe of Florida. After the passage of the Indian Removal Act in 1830, the Seminole resisted relocation, creating tension between the two groups that broke in 1835, where a band of Seminole led by Osceola ambushed two American companies marching to Fort King and killed all but three whites. The attack was known as the Dade Massacre. On the same day, Osceola led a force that killed seven outside Fort King, including General Wiley Thompson. The Seminole continued to raid US settlements around Florida in 18353 and 1836. The US Army was rather small at the time, with only 7500 soldiers, while the Seminole were experienced and frequently engaged in guerrilla warfare. In 1836, Major General Thomas Jesup was charged with ending the war. He turned it into a war of attrition, gathering a force of 9000 men and gradually wearing the Seminole down. On December 25, 1637, Colonel Zachary Taylor led a force of 800 against the Seminole's 400 in the Battle of Lake Okeechobee. The Seminole suffered few casualties, but were forced to retreat. A similar scene played out in the Battle of Loxahatchee, where sailors and soldiers led by Navy Lieutenant Levin Powell were forced to retreat after a large group of Seminole showed up. Jesup led a force of 1500 that successfully defeated the Seminole. Loxahatchee was the last major battle, with the next four years being mostly minor engagements. By 1842 a few thousand Seminole had been relocated to the Creek reservation, with only 300 Seminole left in Florida. A few hundred Seminole were allowed to stay on an informal reservation in Southern Florida (shown in the picture)

Title: National debt is paid off
Description: The entire national debt is paid off by President Andrew Jackson. This was the only time in the country's history where the federal government was completely debt-free, as they would fall back under the next year (and also suffer an economic recession). Jackson, like many things, hated debt. Before he ran for president, he was a land speculator, and hated getting into debt. Jackson started selling off US land in the West, as well as vetoing every spending bill he could. By the beginning of 1836, Jackson had not only paid all the $58 million the country owed, but even managed to get a surplus. Jackson invested the extra money in state banks (as he had already killed the National Bank), who proceeded to overprint paper currency, causing a massive devaluation of US money, causing the Panic of 1837. To help with the recession, the government started borrowing money again, plunging the country back into debt.

Description: A key conflict in the Texas Revolution, it was a 13-day siege followed by a Mexican attack on the Alamo mission. Mexican troops under President General Antonio López de Santa Anna attacked Texian troops hiding in Alamo. Santa Anna's actions were considered cruel by the Texians, who used the attack as a rallying point to successfully convince people to enlist in the army.

Title: Gag rule
Description: The gag rule over slavery was passed in Congress, known as the "Pinckney Resolutions." It banned Congressmen from reading aloud any petitions for abolition. This was in response to the hundreds of thousands of petitions they received every year for such an action. Southern politicians grew tired of these, and passed the rule championed by SC Congressman Charles Pinckney. Abolitionist Congressmen, led by ex-President John Q. Adams, who protested that the rule infringed on the freedom of petition guaranteed by the 1st Amendment. The objections to the gag rule helped catapult the Whigs into a Congressional majority. The rule was repealed on December 3, 1844.

Description: A slave revolt on the slave ship La Amistad. 53 Mende slaves had been illegally taken from modern-day Sierra Lione and transported to Havana, Cuba (as the international slave trade had been banned by both the US and Great Britain). The slaves escaped from captivity, proceeding to kill a few members of the crew, including the captain. They demanded the navigator take them back to Africa, but were deceived and taken to Long Island, NY, where they were captured. In a Supreme Court ruling, it was determined that the slaves were captured illegally and that the rebellion was in self-defense.

He says they resolved that "the events of the last five or six years leave no room for doubt that the SLAVE POWER is now waging a deliberate and determined war against the liberties of the free states", citing the Cincinnati Philanthropist from September 17, 1839. I could not find an archive of this paper, but I did find an invitation issued to William Lloyd Garrison to attend the convention, citing the date as the last Wednesday of July 1839 (the 31st). I cannot seem to find very much on this convention outside of this one article.

Description: Sometime in 1844, the Native American Party, later re-named the American Party, but commonly known as the Know-Nothing Party, was founded. Its name comes from the party's initial secrecy, as any member that was asked about it was supposed to reply, "I know nothing." It was highly nativist, and was mainly focused around restricting immigration, especially of Catholics. Their main targets were Irish and German immigrants, who constituted the majority of people coming to America at the time. They ran Millard Fillmore for president in 1856, but lost. They never got a president elected, but had many seats in other positions. They dissolved by 1860.

Title: Irish Potato Famine
Description: A period of great famine in Ireland brought about by a potato blight. The Irish grew almost exclusively potatoes, so when the blight hit, the people were left with very little food. An intense famine set in, with one million dying over the course of four years. A large number of Irish also emigrated in order to escape the famine, with many arriving in the US, around five million by the end of the decade. Though America was known as the land of golden opportunity for immigrants seeking a better life, Irish immigrants tended to face strong discrimination upon arrival. Most Irish immigrants were poor, Catholic, and spoke little English, none of which pleased American nativists. They were usually unable to apply for high-paying jobs due to hiring discrimination, such as the famous phrases "Irish need not apply" or "No Irish need apply." As such, they were usually stuck in working-class jobs, such as railroad construction. After the famine was over, immigration for Ireland fell, as did nativist sentiment.

Title: Bear Flag Revolt
Description: A revolt by a group of American settlers that rebelled against Mexico and declared California to be an independent republic.

Mexico feared the growing number of American settlers in California were not interested in becoming Mexican citizens and wanted the US to annex the area. On the eve of the Mexican-American War, the settlers feared the Mexicans would preemptively strike them to avoid rebellion. US Army officer John C. Fremont (later a politician) encouraged the locals to create a militia, which on June 14 captured Sonoma, a Mexican outpost near San Francisco. They arrested retired Mexican General Mariano Vallejo and his family, though he was in favor of US annexation of California.

The rebels created a flag featuring a California grizzly bear and declared California to be an independent republic, including a star as reference to the "Lone Star Republic" of Texas, which was its own country after seceding from Mexico. In July, the rebels learned that the US, who had declared war on Mexico, had successfully invaded California. As the US was accomplishing what the rebels wanted, the Bear Republic dissolved on July 9.

The flag the rebels made was officially adopted as the California flag in 1911.

Previously, the Oregon Country was composed of territories from modern-day Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Wyoming, Montana, and British Canada, and was jointly occupied between the US and Great Britain. The treaty granted Great Britain the land above the 49th parallel, while the US acquires the land below it. However, Polk's supporters were less than pleased with this arrangement, as the president had previously promised the country all of the territory south of the 54°40' parallel. This dispute gave rise to the slogan "54°40' or fight!" However, the agreement was not changed and the land above the 49° was ceded to the British.

Title: Cayuse War
Description: A conflict between the US and Cayuse tribe in the Northwest Territory. It started because of the Whitman Massacre on November 29, 1847, where a misunderstanding between the two sides lead to the Cayuse attacking the Whitman Mission at present-day Walla Walla, WA, killing 14. The Oregon governor organized a militia of 50 known as the Oregon Rifles, who participated in minor skirmishes with the Cayuse. In January 1848, 500 militiamen were organized and continued to fight both friendly and hostile Cayuse. In 1850 the tribe surrendered 5 Native Americans the US suspected in the participation in the Whitman Massacre. Though one pledged innocence, all 5 were found guilty and hanged on June 3, 1850. Conflict continued until 1855, when the Cayuse were defeated.

Title: Compromise of 1850
Description: The Compromise of 1850 was a bundle of legislations authored by Senators Henry Clay (W-KY) and Stephen Douglas (D-IL) and passed by Congress in order to appease the conflicts between North and South over the issue of slavery. Proposed on January 29 and approved on May 9, it consisted of the following:

1) California would be admitted to the Union as a free state with no slave counterpart. In 1848, Mexico ceded a large section of their northern territory for losing the war with the US. President Zachary Taylor desired immediate statehood for California and New Mexico, as he hoped to pass the slavery question onto them instead of Congress having to deal with it. The former had a sizable population due to the California Gold Rush of 1849, enough to warrant becoming a state. Because California was not suitable for crops that relied on slave labor to be profitable, there was little enthusiasm for slavery in the territory, making it logical to admit it as a free state. Normally, a slave state counterpart would be admitted to keep the balance of power in the Senate, but no other US territory had enough people to warrant creating one. Instead, Congress considered splitting California in two along the Missouri Compromise line, naming the northern part California and the southern part Colorado. The Californians didn't want to be divided, though, so their final solution was to promise to send one pro-slavery senator and one anti-slavery senator to Washington, DC at all times in order to preserve the balance. This was difficult for California to uphold, however, because of the aforementioned lack of enthusiasm for slavery there.

2) The slave trade (not slavery) was abolished in Washington, DC. It was seen as a bad reflection on American character when the slave trade was legal in the federal capital of the land of the free. However, because it was still in the South, the practice of slavery itself was allowed to persist. Southerners still viewed it as a concession to the North and strongly opposed it, but were unable to block the legislation from passing.

3) Texas would drop some of its land claims (setting its present-day borders) in exchange for $10 million to pay off the debt it had accumulated during its war with Mexico. Texas' land claims were quickly becoming an issue for the US. Some of the state's claims were above the Missouri Compromise line, which should be free of slavery, yet Texas was a slave state and therefore all of its land should be open to the practice. Texas also claimed a much larger area of land than they were actually able to control. Included in this claim was much of modern-day New Mexico, who had been at odds with Texas since the 1841 Santa Fe Expedition. New Mexico was opposed to slavery, while Texas was strongly in favor of it. Austin, the Texan capital, lay hundreds of miles away from Santa Fe, the prominent city in New Mexico, and so the New Mexicans felt that they were distinctly separate from their eastern neighbor. The debate on the Senate floor was so heated, at one point Mississippian Henry S. Foote drew a pistol on Missourian Thomas Hart Benton. Though many Southerners strongly advocated against the Texan cession, as they wanted as much land to be open to slavery as possible, President Millard Fillmore shut them down, proclaiming that the US had promised to protect New Mexico in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Fearing defeat, Texas' senators accepted Stephen Douglas' compromise, in which the state gave up its claims north of the Missouri Compromise line, as well as land west of the 103rd meridian and north of the 32nd parallel in exchange for its war debt being paid off by Congress.

4) The Utah and Mexico Territories (larger than the modern-day states) would be allowed to determine the legality of slavery within their borders through popular sovereignty. There was debate over whether or not to allow slavery in these territories. On the one hand, they were geographically southern and were below the Missouri Compromise line, which indicated future slave states. However, like California the area was not good for anything that slavery was profitable for (like growing cotton), and anyway the Missouri Compromise line did not actually extend that far west. Stephen Douglas, a Democratic senator from Illinois, was a strong proponent of popular sovereignty, or the ability for the people to govern themselves. He proposed that the residents of the territory vote on the legality of slavery once there were enough of them. However, the territories remained sparsely populated for several decades, and only Nevada would be admitted to the Union as a (free) state before the abolition of slavery at the federal level.

5) The passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, an upgraded form of the one from 1793. The most hated part of the Compromise of 1850 by the North, it required citizens and officials of Northern states to return escaped slaves to their masters in the South. The original act had been weakened by the Prigg v. Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision, which ruled that states did not have to help in hunting down fugitive slaves. The 1850 law strengthened the original by imposing a fine on those harboring fugitive slaves and requiring officials to return slaves to any Southerner who claims ownership over them. The North instantly refused to comply with the law once it was passed. Wisconsin attempted to nullify the law, but was overruled by the Supreme Court, convincing Northerners that the judicial branch had been taken control of by "slave powers." Vermont passed a law requiring officials to help fugitive slaves, causing uproar among pro-slavery Americans. Virginia governor John B. Floyd warned that the law may convince the South to secede, and President Fillmore threatened to send the military into Vermont to force compliance with the act. It inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe to write the famous abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, and galvanized many Northerners previously indifferent towards slavery to take action by smuggling slaves into Canada through the Underground Railroad.

These were originally passed as an omnibus bill, proposed by Clay, but was unable to pass the Senate. At this point, Clay was feeling too ill to continue, leaving Douglas to take over the debate. Douglas split the bill into individual bills, all of which passed. Taylor was opposed to the compromise, but was replaced by Vice President Millard Fillmore upon his death. Fillmore supported the compromise, and signed all of the bills into law. The Compromise of 1850 sharply divided the country along sectional lines. It was opposed by Northerners that felt too many concessions were made to the pro-slavery movement, and feared that the institution could now expand into the Southwest. They especially hated the Fugitive Slave Act, feeling that they were now being forced to partake in something morally rephrensible. Northern Opposition included most Northern Whigs, who were led by William Seward, who delivered a famous speech to the Senate, in which he proclaimed that slavery was prohibited by “a higher law than the Constitution.” The compromise was also opposed to pro-slavers led by John C. Calhoun, who strongly opposed the creation of new free states. However, calls for disunion by the South did cease, at least for the moment. Despite the opposition from radicals, moderates hailed it as the ultimate compromise. One such moderate was President Fillmore, who signed all of the bills over the course of a few days. It was the last action between the Great Triumvirate, often considered the three greatest senators of their time. Calhoun would die later that year, while Clay and Webster passed away two years later. Initially, it seemed a victory for compromise, ensuring stability for a few more years. Fillmore proclaimed the compromise as a "final settlement" of the issues that had been plaguing the problem for decades. However, it would soon prove not to be enough to satisfy the sectional tensions in the nation. It is estimated that the compromise delayed the Civil War by about 10 years, during which time the North industrialized to unprecendented levels, ensuring their victory over the South in the 1860s.

Title: Republican Party founded
Description: Starting as just one of the many third parties vying to fill the void the Whig Party left, the Republican Party soon gathered members of other failed parties like the Free Soil Party, as well as former Whigs. At the time of their foundation, they were focused mainly on abolition, but unlike other parties possessed a comprehensive set of policies for taking office as well. Founded by Hannibal Hamlin (future vice president under Lincoln), they first ran John C. Fremont for president in 1856 and lost, followed by Abraham Lincoln in 1860, who found the first presidential victory for the party. As of 2018, there have been more Republican presidents (19) than any other party (followed by Democrats at 15).

Title: Treaty of Kanagawa
Description: In the 1850s, Commodore Matthew C. Perry was sent to Japan by President Fillmore with some gunships to "negotiate" a trade treaty with the emperor (even though it was the shogun that actually had the power). Before this, Japan had been almost completely isolationist, allowing only a few Dutch and Chinese ships to trade with them. Japan sends a letter back, saying that they agree, but they need five years to prepare a harbor. Commodore Perry comes back with even more gunships and threatens to go to war with Japan if they don't agree right away, and to show he means business he opens fire on some nearby buildings. Japan grudgingly agrees, and in 1854 the two countries sign the Treaty of Kanagawa, which opens two Japanese trading ports to American sailors.

Title: Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854
Description: An act passed by Congress granting the territories of Kansas and Nebraska the ability to decide the legality of slavery through popular sovereignty. In 1854, Democratic Senator Stephen Douglas wanted to build a transcontinental railroad that terminated in his state of Illinois. To do that, the railroad had to pass through either Kansas or Nebraska, and to do that he wanted them to achieve statehood. The question of slavery soon arose, and to combat it Douglas suggested the idea of popular sovereignty be used. The new states' residents would vote to permit or abolish slavery, much like in the Utah and New Mexico territories were allowed to as per the Compromise of 1850. This again contradicted the 36°30' line created by the Missouri Compromise, which prohibited slavery above said parallel, which both Kansas and Nebraska were. However, Douglas, like many Congressmen, assumed the Southern state of Kansas would move to allow slavery, whereas the Northern state of Nebraska would abolish it, allowing the balance of power in the Senate to be maintained. Though he was right about Nebraska, an unexpectedly powerful abolitionist movement in Kansas would lead to the events in Bleeding Kansas.

Title: Third Seminole War
Description: A third conflict between the US Army and the Seminole tribe in Florida. 

On December 20 1855, a group of Seminoles led by Billy Bowlegs attacked a small group of US soldiers led by Lieutenant George Hartstuff, killing several. The Seminoles conducted several raids throughout January 1856. On March 31, they tried attacking Dr. Joseph Braden's plantation, referred to as the "Braden Castle." They captured a few slaves and mules, but the extra weight slowed them down, allowing the US militia to catch up to them and kill two Seminoles. Several small attacks commenced during spring, usually not resulting in any more than a few deaths. On June 16, 20 militiamen attacked some Seminole at the Peace River, killing somewhere between 4 and 20, including Ocsen Tustenuggee, the only Seminole chief waging attacks against US settlements.

In September, US Brigadier General William S. Tarney assumed control of the military in Florida. He planned to pin them down in a swamp, but to no avail. Colonel Gustavus Loomis replaced Harney, and pursued the Seminole across the swamp with specially designed boats. In November 1857, 800 US troops destroyed any Seminole village they found and captured over a dozen Seminole. They attacked again in January 1858, destroying more Seminole towns. Billy Bowlegs was contacted and asked to move to a separate reservation set aside for them in exchange for $100 or more for each Seminole. Over 100 Seminole, including Bowlegs, agreed and move by early May. The US declared the war to be over by May 8.

The Seminole presence in Florida was greatly diminished, leaving only 100-200 by 1858, with even more moving out in the coming years. The troops were withdrawn, as were the militia, and the forts were decommissioned.

Title: Caning of Charles Sumner
Description: Senator Preston Brooks (D-SC) attacks abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner (R-MA) with a gold-tipped walking cane. This was in response to Sumner's recent speech that strongly condemned slaveholders, including a relative of Brooks. Brooks nearly beat him to death, not stopping even when his cane snapped in two. Several senators tried to intervene, but others still held them back. Eventually, the two were broken up and Sumner was sent to the hospital, while Brooks was arrested and fined the equivalent of $8000. This attack sharply polarized the nation, with Southerners celebrating Brooks as a hero and the North recognizing Sumner as a martyr of sorts.

Title: Guano Islands Act
Description: An act passed by Congress granting the US authority to annex any unclaimed islands discovered to contain guano.

While the US had claimed upwards of 200 islands from this act, it has since withdrawn all of those claims save ten. These islands include Baker Island, Howler Island, Jarvis Island, Midway Atoll, Johnston Atoll, Navassa Island, and Kingman Reef. They are part of a group of US islands known as the US Minor Outlying Islands. Only Midway Atoll is inhabited today, with just 40 residents.

Title: Third American Party System
Description: Devised mainly around the issue of slavery, the Third American Party System featured the Democratic and Republican Parties. In this period of time, Democrats were the primary party in the South and supported conservative policies like low tariffs or resistance to reforms. The Republicans were composed of former Whigs, Free Soilers, and other failed parties. They were the liberal party, backing social reforms like black rights. They were nationalist and expansionist, as well. They adopted much of the Whig ideology. People were even more loyal to their parties, with voter turnout remaining at around 70-80% each election. After the Civil War, both parties were controlled by businessmen until the 1890s.

Democratic Party
-Party of the South, but still had support from farmers, workers, and Catholic immigrants
-economically conservative, including low tariffs
-opposed reforms like Prohibition
-supported states' rights, slavery, and racial discrimination

Republican Party
-founded by former Whigs, Free-Soilers, and some former Northern anti-slavery Democrats
-supported by businessmen, the middle class, and blacks
-strongest in the North and West
-similar to the Whigs in that they supported urbanization and industrialization, as well as education
-nationalist
-supported moral reforms like Prohibition

Title: <i>Dred Scott v. Sandford</i>
Description: The Dred Scott Decision was the verdict laid down by the Taney Supreme Court in the case Dred Scott v. Sandford. Dred Scott was a slave who had been taken by his masters from the slave state of Missouri to Illinois, which was designated free under the Missouri Compromise. When he was taken back to Missouri to be a slave, Scott sued, claiming that his presence in free territory automatically emancipated him. After losing in both Missouri state court and US federal court, he appealed to the Supreme Court. They ruled 7-2 against Scott, with Chief Justice Roger B. Taney writing that blacks were never intended to be considered US citizens, and therefore were entitled to none of the associated rights and privileges. One of these rights was the ability to sue, and so Scott would automatically lose any federal lawsuit he was involved in due to not meeting the "diversity of citizenship" required by Article III of the Constitution. Taney based his conclusion off of various historical precedents. Despite concluding that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction in the case due to Scott's lack of citizenship, he continued further. He wrote that the Missouri Compromise, which banned slavery in territories north of the 36° 30' parallel, was unconstitutional, as it deprived slave owners of their right to property (which included slaves) without due process, which is required by the 5th Amendment. Associate Justices Curtis and McLean dissented, the former writing that Taney's historical precedents of blacks being denied citizenship were faulty, and the latter decrying Taney's decision to strike down the Missouri Compromise despite rendering the case invalid. President-elect James Buchanan was discovered to have interfered in the decision, pursuading Northern Associate Justice Robert Cooper Grier to vote with the Southerners to avoid the decision appearing split along sectional lines. Republicans speculated that Taney had informed Buchanan of the decision before his inaugural address, in which he proclaimed the slavery problem would be solved under his administration. Buchanan's interference in the decision was regarded as highly improper. Both Buchanan and Taney hoped the decision would put an end to the slavery debate. Instead, it only served to cause more bitterness and distress. The decision was celebrated in the South as the correct interpretation of the Constitution, with Senator and future President of the Confederacy Jefferson Davis being among its key proponents. Taney had accomplished the long-awaited goal of Democrats to totally repeal the Missouri Compromise. Northerners beame convinced that the Supreme Court had been taken over by the "slave power", and became more opposed to slavery than ever. They feared that Taney was just one step away from declaring free states unconstitutional. With this in mind, the Republican Party gained significant backing, helping it win the 1860 presidential election. Fear over whether or not the entire West would become a battleground like Kansas paralyzed the markets. Several key railroads failed, followed by the collapse of several banks, triggering the Panic of 1857 in the North. Today, the Dred Scott Decision is widely regarded as among the worst the Supreme Court has ever made.

Title: Election of 1860
Description: A landmark presidential election placing Republican Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president over Northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, Southern Democrat John C. Breckenridge, and Constitutional Unionist John Bell. Notably, Lincoln appeared to have won exactly zero votes in the South due to most Southern states refusing to even place Lincoln's name on the ballot. This election was the final straw for the South, who saw Lincoln as a radical that would abolish slavery. Less than two months after the election, the South began to secede from the Union.

Title: Crittenden Compromise
Description: A failed proposal that attempted to forestall the secession of the South by placating them on the issue of slavery. Proposed by Constitutional Unionist KY Senator John J. Crittenden, it proposed a series of Congressional legislation and six constitutional amendments that guaranteed the existence of slavery where it was already legal. It also suggested the re-institution of the Missouri Compromise line that would be unrepealable, and then be extended to California. It appealed to Democrats, but was rejected by Republicans, especially Abraham Lincoln, unwilling to accept such major concessions to the South and to slavery.

The companies were lacking in laborers to construct the railroad, so they employed large numbers of Chinese immigrants, who could be paid very little and who would often work on the most arduous and dangerous activities. The project would be finished in 1869.

Title: Second Battle of Bull Run
Description: A decisive victory for the Confederate over the Union at Prince William County, VA. While Lee's army was heading to Maryland, Stonewall Jackson captured a supply depot at Manassas, which was important to the Union's communication line with the capital. On August 28, he attempted an attack on Major General John Pope's column, but to no avail. The next day, Pope was confident he had Jackson surrounded, convincing him to launch a repulsed attack that took many lives on both sides. He tried the same thing the next day on August 30, but the attack was foiled by a combined attack by the Confederacy. General James Longstreet charged his 25,000 men at Union Major General Fitz John Porter's line while the Union were being bombarded with artillery shells. It being the biggest simultaneous mass assault of the war, it delivered a crushing blow to the Union Army. Pope was fired, and Porter was court-martialed. It was a key victory for the Confederacy.

Title: Emancipation Proclamation
Description: An executive order issued on January 1 by Abraham Lincoln. It declared the emancipation of all slaves in the Confederate states. It did not immediately free any slaves, as the Union had little control over the Confederacy and it did not emancipate any slaves in the border states (slave states loyal to the Union), but nevertheless was a great cause for celebration for the abolitionist movement. It changed the reason for the Civil War to be about slavery, inspiring many more to join the cause. It gave slaves further incentive to run away, knowing that they could find freedom in the North (as opposed to earlier in history, where the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 would have required Northerners to return them to the South).

Title: Reconstruction
Description: The post-Civil War period that oversaw the redevelopment of both the North and South that had been ruined by the conflict. Additionally, plans were created and executed to punish or forgive the South for their transgressions. 

The moderate Republican plan, championed by Lincoln in 1863, involved Southerners pledging loyalty to the Union to receive amnesty and restoration of all non-human property. Once 10% of the Confederacy had pledged loyalty, they would be allowed to elect their new state government. However, Lincoln died before this could be carried out. 

The Wade-Davis Bill, pushed by radical Republicans in Congress (eg Charles Sumner and Thaddeus Stevens), proposed the seizure and redistribution of plantation land in the South to recently emancipated slaves. This passed Congress, but was not signed by Lincoln.
 
What was eventually passed was President Johnson's plan, which involved pardoning all Confederates except large plantation owners and rebel leaders (most of whom were pardoned individually). He also allowed them to select their own government, leading the South to elect the old aristocracy and Confederate leaders.

This period saw three Constitutional amendments passed, securing black rights. The 13th abolished slavery, the 14th provided guaranteed birthright citizenship, and the 15th guaranteed the suffrage of black males. The last was enforced by the US Army, who was sent by the government to oversee the compliance with the new law in the South. These troops were recalled in 1877 as part of the condition for electing President Hayes, ending the Reconstruction Era.

Title: Sand Creek Massacre
Description: A massacre by the US military against Cheyenne and Arapaho Native Americans. On February 8, 1861, Cheyenne leader Black Kettle signed the Treaty of Fort Wise, ceding most of the tribe's territory in an exchange for a 600-square mile reservation in Colorado. In June 1864, Colorado Governor John Evans invited Native Americans friendly to the Union to camp near the military forts for protection. Black Kettle and his people moved there in August, and was encouraged to hunt by Sand Creek. In late November, Colonel John Chivington and his troops launched an unprovoked assault against the Cheyenne, along with the Arapaho that were also at the creek. They killed over 100, mutilating the bodies and burning their village down. Though the massacre was celebrated at first, investigations conducted revealed the attack for what it was. Chivington resigned his post, but aside from that no punishment was ever administered for the perpetrators.

Title: Freedman's Bureau founded
Description: A federal organization dedicated to helping blacks integrate into society after their emancipation. They offered legal, educational, and medical assistance, as well as help with housing and food. Tennessee President Johnson vetoed the renewal of the Bureau in February 1866, but was overturned by the radical Republican Congress. The Bureau was constantly understaffed, underfunded, and frequently assaulted by white supremacy groups like the KKK. Despite this, they managed to provide help to millions of people until their dissolution in 1872 by Congress under pressure from white Southerners

Title: Powder River War
Description: A conflict between the US military and the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho Native Americans. It started with the Battle of Platte Bride, in which Native American warriors attacked a bridge that was cutting through their territory. A punitive expedition was ordered on Powder River County, with the first battle commencing on August 13 at Crazy Women's Fork between the Pawnee Scouts led by Captain Frank J. North (employed by the US military) and a group of Cheyenne warriors. After North's success, he ambushed another group of Cheyennes at the Powder River Massacre on August 16. On August 28, Brigadier General Patrick E. Connor attacked and destroyed an Arapaho village in the Battle of Tongue River on August 29. US troops and Native Americans skirmished along the Powder River for the first week of September. On the 8th, 2000 US troops and civilians happened upon a Native American village of 2500, leading to a fight, though few were killed (less than five). The expedition was ended by Connor due to his deeming of most of the troops to be unfit for service. The expedition was largely unsuccessful for the US, as it did not significantly intimidate the Native Americans or reduce their power in the region. Further attempts would be made at taking the Powder River county in Red Cloud's War.

31 US troops killed
15 US troops wounded

Title: Alaska Purchase
Description: The US purchase of the territory of Alaska from the Russians. The Eurasian country wanted to sell the territory due to a lack of resources and its inhabitability. The US desired the land to remove Russian presence from North America. Additionally, both sides were in favor of surrounding and possibly annexing British Columbia. Russia hoped to take away power from its semi-European rival and the US was eager for any land it could get its hands on. Specifically, the US was interested in the Aleutian Islands, which stretched across the North Pacific Ocean to Asia. It was believed that these islands would make good coaling stations for trans-Pacific ships. The deal was made between US Secretary of State William H. Seward and Russian Minister to the US Eduard de Stoeckl. The US purchased all 586,412 miles of Alaskan Territory for $7.2 million (~2¢/acre). The reception to the US public was mostly supportive, but a few media outlets criticized the high price and also thought the land to be useless. The deal was nicknamed "Seward's Folly" and the territory "Seward's Icebox." The complaints quickly faded when gold was discovered in the territory in 1896.

Title: First transcontinental railroad
Description: The world's first transcontinental railroad was opened in the United States. It connected Sacramento, CA with Council Bluffs, IA, spanning 1,912 miles. This connected the westernmost parts of the US with the rest, allowing for settlement of the frontier much more quickly, as instead of sailing around the continent or traveling for months in a wagon, people could arrive effortlessly in just a few days. It connected people more strongly, allowing businesses to think and market nationally instead of locally. This allowed foe the national economy to expand rapidly, helping the Second Industrial Revolution to take place and secure the country's place as a global commercial power.

Title: Knights of Labor founded
Description: The Knights of Labor (KOL) was one of the first labor unions in the US. Though founded by Uriah Stephens, it is most closely associated with Terrence Powderly. They were most powerful during the mid-1880s, with 800,000 members by 1886 (20% of all workers). 

Their main platform was for an 8-hour workday, but also pushed for an end to child labor and a graduated income tax. They would accomplish this by way of strikes, as well as a "cooperative commonwealth" between workers and companies. The KOL was unique in that it was open to almost all groups of people, including blacks, women, Catholics, and immigrants (though not the Chinese, as they feared their jobs would be taken by them). However, their main demographic was to the working class. Because of this, the union was very diverse and contained many different perspectives. However, they were often the scapegoat for attacks by radicals, as the KOL contained an anarchist sect. The Haymarket Square Riot dealt a huge blow to their movement, as several KOL members were convicted for starting the incident. Ultimately, they were seen as too radical, and were quickly losing members to their rival union, the AFL. In 1890, there were only 100,000 left, with membership quickly declining thereafter. The group persisted with about 50 members until 1949, when it officially disbanded.

Title: Standard Oil founded
Description: The oil corporation Standard Oil was founded by John D. Rockefeller. At its time, it was the largest oil refinery in the world. It specialized in the technique of horizontal integration, meaning that it eliminated all of its competition by buying them up or bankrupting them, effectively securing a monopoly on US oil. The company suffered its demise in 1911, when the Supreme Court ruled in <i>Standard Oil of New Jersey v. United States</i> that the corporation violated the anti-monopoly law the Sherman Antitrust Act, and forced it to dissolve into 32 separate companies, including modern-day Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

-deployed US troops to Southern states in order to enforce the 15th Amendment
-suspended habeas corpus for these purposes

The second and third acts, passed in 1870 and 1871, were revisions to this law. The main part of the act was the third point, as it forced the South to allow blacks the right to vote. President Grant used the law to fine or imprison hundreds of Klansmen, managing to essentially destroy the organization. These troops were later recalled by President Hayes as per the Compromise of 1877.

Title: Great Chicago Fire
Description: A large 3-day fire in Chicago, IL. 

There is no confirmation of the fire's origin, but the most prevailing tale was peddled by Chicago Tribune's Michael Ahern, who blamed Mrs. O'Leary's cow knocking over a lantern as the fire's catalyst. However, Ahern later admitted he had fabricated the story. Lawyer Richard Bales, who looked into the incident for evidence, suspected the perpetrator to be Daniel "Pegleg" Sullivan, the first to warn the city of the fire. Other theories include fires already existing around Chicago or a meteor impact.

What is known is that the fire started around the O'Leary family barn, and soon spread rapidly across the largely-wooden city, exacerbated by drought conditions. The fire burned until October 10, where rain combined with the effort from firefighters extinguished the last of the flames. Looters took advantage of the chaos until October 11, when martial law was declared in the city.

Title: Slaughterhouse cases
Description: A Supreme Court decision determining that the "Privileges and Immunities" clause of the 14th Amendment only applied to federal citizenship and the rights associated with it. The decision arose from several Supreme Court cases involving slaughterhouses. 

In 1860s New Orleans, entrails from butchered animals were tossed into the Mississippi River, contaminating the city's drinking water. In response, Louisiana passed a law Creating a New Orleans-based corporation, the Crescent City Livestock Landing and Slaughter-House Company, which would gather all slaughterhouses in the city around the South and away from the Mississippi. All slaughterhouses had to work under Crescent City, granting the company a monopoly in the city. 

Several lawsuits by the Butchers' Benevolent Association were fruitless, as the courts all ruled in favor of Crescent City. A few cases were then appealed to the Supreme Court. The butchers argued that Crescent City violated their rights under the 14th Amendment. This had originally been intended to grant citizenship to newly-emancipated blacks during Reconstruction, but no specification of race was included in the wording of the amendment, meaning that it technically applied to all US citizens. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the 14th Amendment was only to apply to former slaves, and anyway it only pertained to rights granted by national citizenship, not state. Therefore, the butchers' rights were not infringed. 

Crescent City would last until 1879, when the Louisiana government dissolved it. The decision was significant because it significantly limited the reach of the 14th Amendment.

Title: Women's Christian Temperance Union founded
Description: The Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was founded, which strived to create a "sober and pure world" by banning the manufacture and sale of drinking alcohol. It believed that alcohol was the root of many social problems, such as domestic violence, which was why they wanted it abolished. Over time, the WCTU increased both in membership (with 500,000 members by 1890) and scope, until it began focusing on female suffrage. It asserted that women were not weak and dependent (indeed, they claimed that women were the morally superior sex), and became the largest female organization of the time. The WCTU still exists today.

Title: <i>Minor v. Happersett</i>
Description: A Supreme Court case in which it was ruled that the Constitution did not grant anyone the right to vote. The case arose because of Virginia Minor, a member of the National Woman Suffrage Association, who attempted to vote in Missouri. The state had passed a law preventing women from voting, so Minor sued the voting registrar, Reese Happersett. Minor argued that the 14th Amendment granted her the "privileges and immunities of citizenship," of which suffrage was one. However, the Court ruled in a 9-0 decision that while the 14th Amendment did make Minor a citizen, suffrage was not an inherent right of US citizens. Therefore, the Constitution did not grant anyone citizenship. This decision killed a large part of women's rights movements, as the only way to counter the decision would be a repealing of said decision by the Court or a constitutional amendment by Congress. The latter would later occur in 1920, where the newly passed 19th Amendment would prevent sex as a limiting factor for suffrage.

Title: Black Hills War
Description: Otherwise known as the Great Sioux War of 1876, it was a conflict between the US against the Cheyenne and Sioux Native Americans. It was over the Black Hills, grounds sacred to the Sioux. Gold was discovered in the Black Hills, causing thousands of American prospectors to infringe upon the Fort Laramie Treaty that protected the land from US encroachment and go looking for gold. Initially, the US Army was deployed to kicked out prospectors, but was soon stopped by President Grant. After the Sioux refused to move to the Indian Territory in modern-day Oklahoma, the US sent the military to forcefully evict them.

On March 17, 1876, Colonel Joseph J. Reynolds sent troops to burn a Northern Cheyenne village. They succeeded, but were repulsed before they could continue attacking. The war climaxed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, where Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer and his men were killed by Native American warriors on June 25. General George Crook burned a small village and defeated a punitive Native American force led by Crazy Horse the next day. Colonel Nelson A. Miles pushed deep into Sioux territory, forcing many Sioux into surrendering or fleeing to Canada. On November 25, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie defeated a village of Northern Cheyenne in the Dull Knife Fight, convincing the tribe to surrender and be relocated to Indian Territory.

The large pressure from US military forces, combined with intense diplomatic attempts to push the Sioux into submission, came to fruition in April 1877, where leaders began surrendering en masse. The last surrender was made by Crazy Horse on May 5, though he was later stabbed to death by an American soldier.

The war divided the Lakota tribe. As compared to Red Cloud's War, most Lakota had already been relocated to reservations and did not support the war. The Lakota began to become inspired by the Ghost Dance movement, which would help lead to the Wounded Knee Massacre.

Casualties: 
310 US and US-allied Native Americans killed

Title: Battle of the Little Bighorn
Description: The largest battle in the Great Sioux War of 1876, it was a conflict between US forces under Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer and an alliance of Sioux and Cheyenne warriors under Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull. Custer tracked Sitting Bull to a massive village by the Little Bighorn River in the Montana Great Plains. Custer severely underestimated the Native American forces, putting their numbers at 800 as opposed to the several thousand they actually had lying in wait to attack. He then made the fatal mistake of dividing his forces into three to scout the area. He realized he did not have enough soldiers to take the village, to he sent a scout to contact the rest of the army. Meanwhile, warriors led by Crazy Horse surrounded Custer and his men and attacked. Custer retreated to a hilltop, but he, along with all 200 of his men, were killed. The event became known as Custer's Last Stand, one of the worst defeats suffered by the US military. The loss enraged the American people, and generated more enthusiasm for attacking the Sioux and Cheyenne.

274 US troops dead
49 US troops wounded

Title: Election of 1876
Description: A presidential election that placed Ohio Republican Rutherford B. Hayes as the 19th president over New York Democrat Samuel J. Tilden. It was notable due to the highly contested results and the controversial deals that resulted from it. The first electoral vote count put Tilden at 184 and Hayes at 165, with 20 votes from three states (FL, LA, SC) in dispute, which were the only Southern states still under Republican control. To settle the dispute, a special electoral commission of 15 was created, comprised of five Congressmen, five Senators, and five Supreme Court justices. 7 were Democrats, and 8 were Republicans (though one was ostensibly independent). They voted along party lines to award all three states to Hayes, winning him the presidency by one vote. Meanwhile, the Compromise of 1877 was struck, guaranteeing Democratic cooperation in Congress in return for the removal of troops from the South. It is uncontested that Tilden won the popular vote but lost the presidency, one of only five times in the country's history to happen.

Title: Compromise of 1877
Description: An informal, unwritten compromise between the Democratic and Republican Parties just after the election of 1876. Due to the contested states leaving the electoral college unable to decide a victor, it was proposed and accepted that Rutherford B. Hayes would win all three states (thus winning the presidency by one electoral vote) in return for the following:
-the removal of all US troops from the South (stationed from the Enforcement Acts
-the appointment of at least one Southern Democrat to the presidential cabinet

However, there was no confirmation this compromise ever took place, as Hayes had announced his support for the removal of US troops during his campaign, and it was fairly commonplace for a narrowly elected president to appoint a cabinet member from the opposing party.

Title: Nez Perce War
Description: A conflict between the US and the Nez Perce tribe in the West (OR, ID, MT, and WY) over land. In 1855, the Treaty of Walla Walla was signed, granting the tribe 7.5 million acres of land in the territory they controlled. However, the US infringed upon this agreement in 1877 and insisted the tribe move to a reservation in Idaho. The Nez Perce refused, spurring the US to send the military in to force them. A couple hundred Nez Perce fled to Canada for safety, while a smaller group attempted to fend off the US attackers. The war climaxed with the Battle of the Big Hole in southwest MT Territory, where both the Nez Perce and the US suffered several dozen casualties. Nearly all the Nez Perce leaders, such as Looking Glass, Ollokot, and Toohoolhoolzote, were killed. On September 30, the US Brigadier General Nelson A. Miles led a surprise attack on Nez Perce Chief Joseph, who surrendered by October 5. In his famous speech, Chief Joseph declared that "I am tired of fighting. Our chiefs are killed… The little children are freezing to death. My people, some of them, have run away to the hills, and have no blankets, no food. No one knows where they are -- perhaps freezing to death. I want to have time to look for my children, and see how many of them I can find… My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I will fight no more forever."

125 US troops killed

Title: Kansas Exodus
Description: A mass migration of blacks from the South to Kansas, seeking economic opportunity, political equality, access to education, and freedom from violence. The name comes from the Book of Exodus in the Bible, which describes the mass emigration of Jews from Egypt where they were enslaved to the Promised Land. Within two years, 40,000 to 60,000 blacks left for the state. Those who supported the exodus painted Kansas as idyllic as the Promised Land of the Biblical Jews. However, blacks were frequently only hired for menial work in the cities, and even then employers preferred to have white migrants work instead. Nevertheless, the migrants preferred it to the South and most remained.

Title: President Garfield shot
Description: President James A. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station.

Guiteau's motive comes from the 1880 election. Guiteau wrote a speech supporting early Republican candidate and former president Ulysses S. Grant and condemning Winfield Scott Hancock, the Democratic nominee. However, Grant lost to Garfield, prompting Guiteau to quickly revise his speech to "Garfield against Hancock," though he accidentally left some of Grant's accomplishments credited to Garfield. His speech was published but never administered, and not many read it. However, Guiteau not only believed he was the one responsible for Garfield's narrow victory, but that he deserved an important diplomatic position as a reward. Guiteau continued harassing White House officials for his position until he was eventually banned from entering the building. Guiteau then decided he had been ordained by God to assassinate Garfield.

He purchased a revolver, then shot Garfield twice on July 2 as he was to leave the White House for a vacation. Though Garfield was not expected to last the night, he lived for several months. The wounds soon became infected, and it is now estimated that had Garfield had more competent doctors his life could have been saved. He died from an aneurysm on September 19.

Guiteau was soon arrested and brought to trial. Though he acted very strangely in the courtroom and despite the arguments made by the defense, Guiteau was not clinically insane and thus could not be acquitted. He was found guilty and sentenced to death, hanging on January 25, 1882.

Title: Chinese Exclusion Act
Description: A federal law that barred all immigration from China into the US and declared that no Chinese immigrant would be eligible for citizenship. The original law lasted for ten years, but was renewed for another decade in 1892 and made permanent in 1902. As a result, immigration from China to the US (primarily California) was drastically reduced. It was replaced by the Magnuson Act in 1943, which allowed a small number of Chinese (105) to immigrate every year. Immigration eventually increased in 1952, when racial barriers for immigration were abolished.

Title: Pendleton Act
Description: A federal law requiring government positions to be filled based on merit rather than affiliation. This ended what was known as the "spoils system." Introduced by President Andrew Jackson, it involved giving top-level positions in the federal government to political allies, even if they were not qualified to fill the position. The law was added because of the circumstances surrounding President James A. Garfield's assassination. His killer, Charles J. Guiteau, was mad at Garfield because Guiteau believed he deserved an important position in government because of his (perceived) assistance in the 1880 election that won Garfield the presidency. However, he was not granted such a position, leading to the assassination. Furthermore, the Pendleton Act prevented the act of firing or demoting federal employees because of party affiliation. It created the US Civil Service Commission, which was in charge of regulating this law.

Title: Civil Rights cases
Description: A collective decision of five Supreme Court cases that invalidated the Civil Rights Act of 1875. Several cases had been brought before the Supreme Court, all of which were black plaintiffs claiming that their rights had been infringed by various businesses. They had been denied access because the facilities were designated "white only." They claimed that the Civil Rights Act of 1785, which prevented racial discrimination in theaters, public transport, etc, which had been passed by Congress because of the 14th Amendment, which held that no state could infringe on citizens' right to life, liberty, and property. In an 8-1 ruling, the Waite Court determined that the 14th Amendment only applied to state laws, not private businesses. Therefore, the Civil Rights Act was unconstitutional, as Congress had no right to obstruct the business' right to their property. This decision limited Congress's ability to establish racial equality.

Title: <i>Our Country</i>
Description: A book written by clergyman Josiah Strong, in which he updated the idea of manifest destiny. He believed that since Anglo-Saxons had demonstrated their ability to establish liberty, Christianity, and self-government across much of the continent, they should extend these principles to all the "inferior races" across the world. These civilized savages would also begin to purchase American goods, thus benefiting the economy as well. He warned that unless the US acted soon, no land would be left for their empire. The book demonstrated the allure Americans were beginning to see in their country having an overseas empire, which would eventually come true.

The protest was against the killing and wounding of workers by Chicago police the day before. As the police came to end the protest, someone threw a bomb at them, and the riot ensued. The death toll topped at seven police and one protester. Radical foreigners were blamed for the attack, and eight were convicted because of a biased jury despite the lack of evidence. Five were sentenced to death, two had life in prison and one had 15 years. The incident divided the nation; some viewed the killed civilians as martyrs while others turned hostile towards unionists.

Title: <i>Yick Wo v. Hopkins</i>
Description: A Supreme Court case in which it was decided that laws that appear race-neutral on the surface, but are applied in a racist manner, are a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The case originated in San Francisco, where an ordinance was passed that mandated the possession of a permit to operate a laundry in a wooden building (of which over 95% of laundries in San Francisco were). About two-thirds of laundry owners in the city were Chinese, and only one out of 200 applications from Chinese were given a permit. Meanwhile, nearly every non-Chinese applicant received a permit. This was taken to court, where it was decided that such discrimination was "intolerable in any country where freedom prevails." Though the decision was not applied in many future cases due to the 1896 <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> case, it was later cited in the 1950s.

Title: American Federation of Labor founded
Description: The American Federation of Labor (AFL) was founded by Samuel Gompers in Columbus, OH. It gradually became the largest labor union in the US, hitting 250,000 members by 1892, slow compared to the growth of the Knights of Labors' 800,000 in the mid-1880s. Compared to the Knights of Labor, the AFL was much more moderate. It did not organize as many strikes, and was only open to white middle-class workers from industries dominated by small businesses (eg printing, not oil). It also stressed cooperation between workers and corporations, rather than strikes and rebellion encouraged by the Knights. Likely because of this, the AFL saw much more success, and is still around to this day.

Title: Interstate Commerce Act of 1887
Description: A federal act that established the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the first independent regulatory agency. It was designed to regulate railroads to ensure their rates were "reasonable and just."

 The act was passed because there was very little regulation on railroad companies, allowing them to overcharge small farmers while giving discounts for political allies and big businesses. The Grange movement was formed in order to protect farmers from the abuses of these railroad companies. Grangers lobbied Congress for change, but it was the Supreme Court that saved them in the 1886 decision <i>Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Company v. Illinois</i>, in which the Court ruled that interstate railroads violated the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. As a result of this decision, the Interstate Commerce Commission was born.

However, the ICC was rather limited in its abilities. It had the authority to investigate and bring to court railroad companies for unjust practices, but only when the company operated across states. Additionally, the Supreme Court frequently ruled in favor of the corporations when they were brought to trial. The ICC would gain more power through the Hepburn Amendment in 1906, which allowed the ICC to set maximum rates and extended its jurisdiction to beyond railroads, but overall it would continue to have limited effects on business practices. The ICC was abolished in 1995.

Title: Dawes Severalty Act
Description: A federal law authorizing the president to survey Native American-controlled land and break it up into smaller segments. These segments would then be administered to Native American individuals instead of being collectively owned by the tribe. Leftover land would then be sold off to white speculators. Those who accepted this land would be granted US citizenship. The law was passed because white Americans feared Native American power in a group. Many Native Americans had issues with the law, as part of their culture was to stick together as a tribe, allowing them to continue their customs more easily. With the passage of the Dawes Act, they were being encouraged to break away from their lifestyle and adopt US customs, including family-owned land. Native Americans lost 90 million acres of land, and 90,000 Natives had none.

Description: The article "Wealth," better known as the "Gospel of Wealth," was written by business magnate Andrew Carnegie. He explains that the rich, such as himself, have a moral obligation to use their money to give back to society via philanthropy. This was contrary to what had been the practice for millennia, that the rich bequeathed their heirs with their fortune, not poor strangers. He also claimed that extravagant and self-serving spending only encouraged sloth, as well as claiming that it was "a disgrace to die a rich man."

Title: Sherman Silver Purchase Act
Description: A federal law passed in response to the growing demand for free silver from farmers and miners. Many farmers at the time were poor and wanted silver to influence the value of the dollar in order to generate inflation, allowing them to pay off their large debts. At the same time, mining companies had discovered large quantities of silver, which drove down the prices to the point at which silver could be extracted profitably. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act did not create free silver, but it did expand the amount of silver the federal government was required to purchase every month to 4.5 million ounces. The government became the second largest buyer of silver in the world, after only the British Crown, as the Indian rupee (the currency of a British colony) was based off of silver rather than gold. However, investors found out that they could manipulate the low market prices and government exchange rates for gold and silver to make a profit by purchasing silver, exchanging it for gold at the Treasury, then selling the gold back to the market for a profit. This put a heavy drain on US gold reserves, and the act was repealed in 1893 by President Cleveland to protect what remained.

Title: Wounded Knee Massacre
Description: An attack by the US 7th Cavalry Regiment against the Lakota tribe on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation near Wounded Knee River, SD. Americans were nervous about the Ghost Dance religious movement that was taking Native Americans by storm, seeing it as a threat. The 7th Cavalry Regiment arrived at the reservation to confiscate the Native Americans' guns to prevent any 'hostilities.' During this confiscation, a Native American named Yellow Bird started to make the soldiers feel uncomfortable by orating about and performing the Ghost Dance. Meanwhile, the soldiers began to become aggressive towards another Native American named Black Coyote, as he was deaf and did not know what the soldiers were demanding. Despite protests from other Native Americans, the soldiers believed him to be resisting defiantly. Black Coyote's rifle accidentally discharged, leading to the soldiers firing in retaliation. As most Native Americans were disarmed, they stood little chance against the soldiers. This event marked the end of the many wars and conflicts fought between the Europeans/Americans and Native American tribes.

Title: Populist Party founded
Description: The Populist Party, otherwise known as the People's Party, was founded to address the growing concerns of the working class.

 The party's story starts in the 1870s with the creation of the Farmer's Alliance, the largest citizens' movement of the century. They were a politically active organization that proposed legislation to amend the problems faced by workers. For example, they proposed a plan for a subtreasury, in which farmers that could not sell all of their crops could instead give them to the government to store. The crops could then be used as collateral for loans that farmers could take out from the government. This would mean that farmers didn't have to rely on wealthy bankers for their money, who would not give good rates. The organization held sway in regional governments, but to compete on a national scale the Alliance's leaders dropped the organization and created the Populist Party in its place. The party claimed that democracy and liberty had been destroyed by corruption and inequality, and that a large number of reforming would be required to fix it. They mainly appealed to the farmers from the Alliance, but attempted to include others, such as factory workers and even women. They also tried to attract black farmers (such as sharecroppers), but it was never fully realized.

They ran their first presidential candidate, James Weaver, in 1892. He won over 1,000,000 popular votes (9%), nearly all from the West. He even managed to take 22 electoral votes, from states, including all of Kansas, Nevada, Idaho, and Colorado. However, that was still only 5%, nowhere close to winning. They combined their forces with Democratic nominee William Bryan in 1896, but he was only able to take 39% of the electoral college. The Populist Party's ideals were soon absorbed by the Democratic Party entirely, and the third party soon collapsed.

Though the Populists were never able to win a presidential election, many of their suggested policies would be gradually implemented over the next century, such as the popular election of senators or a graduated income tax. It was the most successful third party in the country's history.

Description: Carnegie Steel Company was founded by Scottish-American businessman Andrew Carnegie. The company HQ was based in Pittsburgh, and utilized several modern techniques in the steel production process. The company specialized in vertical integration, meaning that it bought up companies required for every stage of steel production. While the company experienced the 1892 Homestead Strike, it was largely unaffected. In 1901, Carnegie sold the entire company to the US Steel Corporation for $480 million ($14.3 billion in 2017), with $226 million ($6.8 billion in 2017) going directly to Carnegie, making him one of the richest men in the world.

Title: Kingdom of Hawaii overthrown
Description: A coup by Hawaiian subjects, US citizens, and other foreigners that resulted in the deposition of Queen Liliuokalani. Though an independent nation, Hawaii had close ties with the US, with exemptions on tariff duties for sugar, the archipelago's main export. The sugar was produced by American-owned plantations that employed a combination of native Hawaiians, Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos. Additionally, Hawaii allowed for the construction of a US naval base at Pearl Harbor. Conflict began brewing in the 1880s, with a group of mostly foreign rebels forming the Hawaiian Patriotic League. They drafted the Bayonet Constitution in 1887 and forced King Kalākaua to sign it, which greatly diminished his powers. In 1890, Kalākaua died, leaving his sister Liliuokalani to assume the throne. She planned to create a new constitution that strengthened the monarchy, leaving it more powerful than the legislature, where foreign businessmen held most of the power. On January 17, 1893, the rebels organized the Honolulu Rifles, consisting of 1500 men. One of them, John Good, wounded a policeman, and the Rifles began taking over buildings. They were assisted by US Government Minister John Stevens, who sent a company of Marines to Hawaii. Queen Liliuokalani and her supporters were placed under house arrest, and the Republic of Hawaii was declared by the Honolulu Rifles. President Grover Cleveland called for an investigation into the overthrow, where it was found that US military and diplomatic officials had abused their power. Stevens was fired and attempts were made to restore the monarchy, but the insurgent government refused. Meanwhile, a group of pro-annexation senators conducted their own report and acquitted Stevens of any wrongdoing. Cleveland was unable to continue negotiations as a result, and recognized the provisional government as the head of the country. The republic governed until 1898, when it was formally annexed by the US.

They called for barring the illiterate from the US, and lobbied the federal government to pass such a law. Congress attempted it in 1897, but it was vetoed by President Cleveland. The League disbanded after Hall's death in 1921.

Title: Pullman Strike
Description: A large railroad strike, mostly in Chicago, IL, organized by the American Railway Union (ARU). They were protesting that the Pullman Company had cut their wages due to the Panic of 1893, yet the workers' rent costs had stayed the same, leaving many workers unable to afford housing. The ARU, led by Eugene V. Debs, had control of over a third of Pullman workers, who organized a boycott of the company. In just a few days, over 100,000 workers had joined the boycott. On June 29, Debs gave a speech in Blue Island, IL that enraged workers into burning buildings and attacking trains. Workers all over the country joined the strike, prompting federal intervention in the form of Attorney General Richard Olney. He obtained a court injunction demanding that workers quit the strike. When they refused, Brigadier General Nelson Miles commanded a force of over 10,000 US troops, leading to conflict with the workers. Their justification was that the shutdown of the railroad system inhibited the government's duty to deliver mail. Public response was divided, but most people supported Pullman including AFL founder Samuel Gompers.. The media played on American's nativist feelings by portraying the strikers as lawless foreigners. Debs was arrested, but the charges were dropped. The government ordered Pullman to sell is residential facilities. Congress created Labor Day as a federal holiday in an effort to appease workers angry about the event.

Title: Atlanta Compromise
Description: The Atlanta Exposition Speech was written and given by Booker T. Washington, in which he announced the Atlanta Compromise. This was an agreement between Washington and white Southern leaders that proposed blacks submitting to white rule in exchange for basic education and due process of law. Submitting to white rule entailed not creating activist movements to push for black rights. Washington, the president of the Tuskegee Institute, held a large amount of sway in the black community. Washington was a proponent of compromising with whites, instead of stubbornly insisting on full racial equality, something he didn't believe was practical. He advocated for toning down the protests and working together with whites, especially for attaining education, which he believed was a necessary right for blacks.

Title: <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>
Description: A landmark Supreme Court decision that declared racial segregation to be constitutional provided the designated facilities were "separate but equal."

The case was over the constitutionality of the Separate Car Act, a law passed in Louisiana requiring separate cars for blacks and whites on railroads. Homer Plessy, a barely mixed-race man (⅞ white, ⅛ black), classified as a black under Louisiana law, tried to board the white-only car. After he refused to leave, he was arrested and brought to court. After several appeals, his case was brought to the SCOTUS. The Court decided in a 7-1 ruling that although the 14th Amendment guaranteed political equality for all races in the US, it could not guarantee social or any other form of equality. They claimed that as long as the designated areas were equal, there was no way to show that the segregation implied black inferiority. The lone dissenter, John Marshall Harlan, declared that "Our constitution is color-blind," and that in the future people would look at the decision to be as bad as the Dred Scott Decision, a prediction that became true.

Title: "Cross of gold" speech
Description: A speech given by Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, IL. His main concern in the speech, and indeed his campaign, was the gold standard, the practice of assigning a particular value to the dollar based on the current amount of gold possessed by the US. This prevented the currency from fluctuating wildly, as the amount of gold the country had would not drastically change over a short period of time. However, this hurt farmers badly, who were suffering economically at the time due to an excess of supply of crops and livestock. Bryan called for "free silver," which would extend the gold standard to include the amount of silver in US supply as well. Since the US had a large amount of silver, this would allow more money to be produced which would help ease farmers out of debt to banks. Before the speech, Bryan was considered a dark horse candidate with little support, but he became wildly popular after giving it. He pointed out that "Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities will spring up again as if by magic; but destroy our farms and grass will grow in the streets of every city in the country." Bryan was also deeply religious and a strong supporter of the Social Gospel movement. He evoked strong emotions in his audience with Biblical imagery, declaring "You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." As he delivered this last line, Bryan stuck his arms out as if he were being crucified like Jesus. It is often considered to be one of the best political speeches in US history, and helped him win the nomination for president.

Description: The National Association of Colored Women (NACW) was founded, which brought together various clubs in order to advocate for racial and gender equality. They participated in campaigns for women's suffrage, and protested against Jim Crow laws and lynching. They also gave aid to the poor, educated women in house life and child rearing, and fought against gambling and drinking in black communities. Most of all, they challenged the prevailing idea that black women were not as respectable as their white counterparts, as they were frequently portrayed by whites as being prostitutes and thieves. Their first president was Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, and membership grew to 300,000 by 1918. The NACW still exists today.

Title: Gold discovered at Klondike, AK
Description: Gold was discovered in large quantities in Rabbit Creek (modern-day Bonanza Creek) by George Carmack and Skookum Jim. Soon, the entire creek was claimed by prospectors, and 100,000 people flocked to the Alaskan Territory to strike it rich, mostly Americans. Though not as significant as the California Gold Rush, it nevertheless inspired some of the same feelings of romanticism and excitement among the American people, as well as facilitating the creation of new towns and businesses in the region. The enthusiasm for the Gold Rush petered out by 1898, with the Spanish-American War taking up the headlines, after which the rush to Alaska was left behind.

Title: Election of 1896
Description: A presidential election that placed Ohio Republican William McKinley as the 25th president over Nebraska Democrat William Jennings Bryan. This succeeded the election of 1892, in which the Populist Party saw a relatively successful campaign, though they did not come close to winning the election. In 1896, the Democratic Party ran Bryan on their ticket, a man very sympathetic to the Populists' ideals, thus "acquiring" their party. Bryan insisted on campaigning state-by-state, delivering fiery speeches that whipped his audiences into a frenzy. In one such speech, he claimed the working man was being crucified upon a gold cross, a reference to the growing dislike by the working class of the gold standard, an economic system in which the value of the nation's currency was directly tied to how much gold it possessed in its reserves. McKinley, on the other hand, was considered the safer candidate, promising nothing too radical. He also had the advantage of having over thirty times the campaign finances as Bryan, as he was pro-big business and therefore had millions put into his campaign by robber barons (Bryan's campaign raised $300 thousand, while McKinley's hit $10 million). Another distinction of the election was that the two candidates gave speeches themselves, as opposed to the past where candidates had their campaign team vouch for them. When voting day came around, Bryan swept the West and South, but McKinley won the more populated New England and Midwest, securing the presidency for him. The election was significant because it was considered to be the first modern election, and that it showed the changing issues for the parties. It also meant the end of one of the most successful third parties in the country's history.

Description: A book written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in which she suggests that women were growing more independent by being allowed to work in more industries. This would cause a dramatic change in family life and the economy, both of which Gilman argues are good. She writes that women were only kept down in their roles as housewives, essentially servants to their husbands and children. If they were allowed further into the workforce, they could be truly liberated and could contribute to society.

Title: USS <i>Maine</i> explosion
Description: The ship the USS Maine exploded in Havana Harbor, Cuba. The ship was docked there due to the Cuban revolt taking place against Spain. The exact cause of the explosion is unknown. An 1898 naval board appointed by the McKinley Administration found that it was due to a mine explosion. However, there is more evidence that the incident arose due to an internal coal fire that ignited the Maine's magazines, which created the explosion. Nevertheless, the event was heavily politicized. Cuba believed the ship was deliberately blown up by the US in order to manufacture a reason for a war against Spain. The American sensationalist "yellow press" pushed the notion that it was an unprovoked attack by Spain, though they did not provide a clear motive. Regardless of its cause,the McKinley Administration used the destruction of the Maine to declare war on Spain, leading to the Spanish-American War.

Title: Teller Amendment
Description: An amendment to a bill that required all US troops to leave Cuba after its independence had been secured from Spain, allowing it to govern itself. It was passed in order to prove that the US only had humanitarian aims behind the Spanish-American War, not economic or imperialist ones. As promised, after the war, US troops left the island, but the Platt Amendment passed in 1901 forced Cuba to cede important powers to the US, brewing resentment between the two countries.

Title: Spanish-American War
Description: A conflict between the United States and Spain. The war stemmed from the Cuban Revolution, in which Cubans seeked to overthrow their Spanish overlords and establish an independent republic. Spain violently repressed such rebellions, which US media used to shock the country into anger against Spain. Americans began thinking about intervening in Cuba to help them establish independence. Then, on February 15, the USS Maine, docked in the Cuban Havana Harbor, mysteriously exploded. The sensationalist "yellow press" in the US "blamed the Maine on Spain," creating the catchphrase "Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!" Congress used both of these reasons to declare war on Spain on April 21.

The actual war was short and uncontested - Spain's military power was waning rapidly while the US's was on the rise. The first battle was on May 1 at Manila Bay in the Philippines. The US squadron was led by Commodore George Dewey, who destroyed the Spanish armada there in just a few hours with under 10 people wounded. A dozen US ships attacked Puerto Rico's capital of San Juan on May 12.

Dewey then brought Emilio Aguinaldo, a Filipino rebel, from exile in Hong Kong and persuaded him to encourage his fellow Filipinos to revolt against Spain, which they did. US and Filipino forces quickly overwhelmed the Spanish, until Aguinaldo declared Philippine independence on June 12. Guam was captured on June 21, as they had no gunpowder and were unaware that Spain was at war. As for the campaign in Cuba, the US's main goal was to capture the city of Santiago. On June 6, Guantanamo Bay was invaded by sea. On June 24, US forces were ambushed by 2000 Spanish soldiers headed by General Antero Rubín in the Battle of Las Guasimas. On June 29-30, over 400 US and Cuban soldiers tried to land near the San Juan River to deliver supplies, but were repelled by the Spanish at the Battle of Tayacoba. 

On July 1, a group of 15,000 US troops launched an attack against over 1000 entrenched Spanish soldiers in the Battles of El Caney and San Juan Hill. When the troops arrived in Santiago, they began a siege, as well as digging trenches around the city. On July 3, the Battle of Santiago de Cuba commenced, the largest naval engagement of the war, in which US forces defeated the Spanish Caribbean Squadron. Over 1500 soldiers were captured, including Spanish Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete. On he 25th of the month, over 1000 troops led by General Nelson A. Miles landed in southwest Puerto Rico and fought the Battle of Yauco.

Four days after capturing it, the US was driven from Fajardo, Puerto Rico. On August 7, troops started to leave Cuba due to an onset of yellow fever. On August 13, US troops captured the city of Manila, but refused to allow the Filipinos in, ending their alliance in the war and generating resentment that would lead to the Philippine-American War. 

With its navy destroyed, Spain surrendered, causing an armistice to be declared on August 12, with fighting ceasing in Puerto Rico on the 13th, and in the Philippines on the 14th. On December 10, the Treaty of Paris was signed between the US and Spain, forcing the latter to surrender its territories. 

It is one of five wars in which Congress officially declared it so.

Title: Battle of San Juan Hill
Description: The deadliest battle in the Spanish-American War. A few months before the war broke out, Theodore Roosevelt resigned his post as assistant secretary of the navy to raise a cavalry unit named the Rough Riders, composed of cowboys, immigrants, Ivy League athletes, and a few Native Americans. He was strongly pro-war, as he believed it would provide desperately needed unity among Americans. On July 1, the Rough Riders joined the 3rd Cavalry Regiment in attacking Kettle Hill, a strategic location east of Santiago, Cuba. Assisted by Gatling gun fire from Lt. John Parker, the Riders made it to the top of the hill and captured it. Roosevelt and his men then crossed a ravine to assist in the battle at nearby San Juan Hill but were ordered to Kettle to prepare for a Spanish counterattack. It was repelled, and the hill was secured. This put the US Army Fifth Crops in a good position to besiege Santiago, which would put an end to the war. Roosevelt and the Rough Riders attained great fame through the battle.

Title: Treaty of Paris (1898)
Description: A treaty signed between the US and Spain that officially ended the Spanish-American War. After two months of negotiations, it was determined that Spain would cede its claims to the island territories of Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico (PR), and Guam (GU). The US would have control over the latter two, as well as the Philippines in exchange for $20 million. Cuba would have de jure independence, but would be controlled by the US indirectly through the Platt Amendment. Additionally, the US would be granted a permanent military base on Cuba, eventually determined to be Guantanamo Bay.

In the US, Republicans generally supported it, while Democrats were critical that the US was becoming an imperialist empire. Some of these people joined the American Anti-Imperialist League, which included several influential and powerful people including industrialist Andrew Carnegie, author Mark Twain, AFL founder Samuel Gompers, and former president Grover Cleveland. Nevertheless, the treaty was ratified by the US Senate on February 6, 1899 in a 57-27 vote, only one higher than the 2/3 vote required. It went into effect on April 11 the same year.

With the acquisition of several overseas territories, the US transformed into a world power. Filipinos were initially supportive of the war because they believed the US would grant them independence, but when they were officially annexed, the archipelago rebelled against its new colonial overlord. The US economy continued to flourish with the addition of the sugar plantations in Cuba.

Title: Open Door Policy
Description: Secretary of State John Hay authored the Open Door Note, a message to European powers about China. Thanks to the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, China was left vulnerable to conquest by European powers like Great Britain, Germany, France, Russia, Austria, and Italy. Hay feared the country would be carved up and distributed in a manner similar to Africa. In his note, he swore that China would remain open to equal trade with all countries, provided that foreign nations made no move to annex it. The policy was issued out of fear that the US would lose out on valuable trades if the country were conquered, though it also extended sympathy towards anti-imperialist sentiments. Most European countries refused to agree with this policy, as it was not economically incentivising.

Title: Gold Standard Act
Description: A law that fixed gold as the only standard for exchanging for paper currency, ending any practice of "free silver." The US had already mostly been on this system since the Coinage Act of 1872, but this made it official. This practice made it easier to exchange currency with foreign countries that also used the gold standard, like Germany and Great Britain, as well as keeping the currency stable. However, it hurt poor people like farmers, as currency devaluation would help them pay off their debts. The value of the US dollar was fixed at 25 8⁄10 grains of gold at 90% purity. It would remain until 1933.

Description: The Women's Trade Union League was founded. It was inspired by a British organization of the same name, and attempted to associate itself closely with the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Though the AFL was usually tepid towards the WTUL, they did gain more female members and started supporting female suffrage because of them. In 1909, they organized the Uprising of the 20,000, an unsuccessful strike by Jewish women in shirtwaist factories. They supported the 8-hour workday, a minimum wage, worker protections and female suffrage. They disbanded in 1950.

Title: Ford Motor Company founded
Description: The Ford Motor Company was founded by Henry Ford. Ford made large contributions to the automobile and assembly line, allowing them to be used much more practically. In 1908, he invented the Model-T, which was durable enough to drive over the country's bumpy roads. Ford made a niche in the automobile market by focusing on low prices and quick and reliable output, in contrast to the slow but superior craftsmanship of the Mercedes in Europe. The difference was much like how factory-produced goods began to take over from ones made by artisans. In 1913, Ford adopted the moving assembly line, in which automobiles were assembled by workers that placed individual parts onto the car as it traveled along a conveyor belt. This greatly sped up production of cars, making him so much money that he raised the wages of his factory workers to five dollars a day in 1914, over double what most factory workers were paid. However, workers were discontented with working at the company, as they found the work on assembly lines to be much too tedious. Ford also made frequent use of armed detectives and spies to discourage unions from forming. Ford's idea of mass producing goods for mass consumption was named Fordism.

Title: Upton Sinclair's <i>The Jungle</i>
Description: A novel written by muckraker Upton Sinclair, in which he describes the unpleasant living and working conditions of immigrants in Chicago and other large US cities, and proposes socialism as a cure for such social ills. However, what caught the public's attention the most was his depiction of the meat industry. Sinclair writes about how amoral and uncaring the workers were to the animals they slaughtered, and how unsanitary the conditions were in which meat was being prepared. The public was so disgusted by the book that they protested the government fix it. President Roosevelt conducted an investigation into the matter, and confirmed Sinclair's account. Congress then passed the Meat Inspection Act in 1906 to assure the public that their meat would be safe to eat.

Title: Hepburn Act
Description: An amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 that allows the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to set fair rates on railroads, with Congress deciding what constituted a fair rate. The amendment was added because of numerous complaints from poor farmers that they could not afford to pay the outrageous rates charged by railroad companies. The companies were also discriminating against farmers, as they charged less for the transportation of goods from large corporations than from poor farmers, in order for both companies to make a profit. The Hepburn Act allowed the ICC to control the railroad companies, crushing the profitability of the business.

Title: Pure Food and Drug Act
Description: A law that seeked to prevent the contamination of food and drugs not scientifically found to be healthy.

It also created the class of prescription drugs, or ones that could not be purchased without written permission from a licensed physician. It created the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to enforce this law, and gave it the power to prosecute noncompliers.

Title: Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire
Description: A large fire in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City, NY. The workers in the factory at the time were mostly young Italian and Jewish immigrant women, about 500 in total. The factory was located on the 8th, 9th, and 10th floors of the Asch Building in Manhattan. When the fire broke out, the workers tried to escape through the doors, but found that it had been locked by the owner to dissuade thieves and truants. The fire department soon arrived, but their ladders could only reach the 6th floor. In their desperation, 46 workers jumped from the building and died in the fall. After the fire died, a hundred more bodies were found in the factory. As a result, new factory inspection laws and fire codes were passed to prevent such a catastrophe from happening again. It also strengthened organizations like the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) and the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL). The two factory owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, were acquitted of manslaughter but found guilty of wrongful death in a civil lawsuit, and were fined $75 per victim.

Title: <i>Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States</i>
Description: A Supreme Court decision in which Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey was found to be monopolizing the oil industry. The federal government found the company to be violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, but there was dispute over whether Congress could deny acquisitions that would normally be legal, but put a strain on competition. Standard Oil had acquired almost the entire industry in the country, and was producing 20% of US refined oil. After a lengthy deliberation on the meaning of the phrase "restraint of trade" as mentioned in the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Court decided to dissolve Standard Oil into 34 separate companies, including modern-day Exxon Mobil and Chevron.

Title: US involvement in World War I
Description: A massive conflict mostly between European nations and their colonies. The war started with the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip in 1914. Austria-Hungary soon declared war on Serbia, and due to a large network of alliances made in secret, every major European power became involved. France, Russia, and Great Britain formed the Allied Powers, while Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East formed the Central Powers.

The US at this point in time was strongly isolationist, with the public opinion being strongly against entering in the war. US President Wilson embodied this policy (at least for Europe; he had no such issues in intervening in Latin America). The American public had been divided since 1914 on which side to support. However, Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium began tipping the public opinion in the Allied Powers' favor. US arms dealers began selling weapons to Great Britain, even sneaking them on board ships with civilians. Germany shot down one such ship, the Lusitania, with a U-boat in 1915, killing over 100 Americans. Americans started supporting intervention more, but Wilson refused. In 1917, British intelligence intercepted the Zimmermann Telegram, a message sent by Germany urging Mexico to declare war on the US to distract it from the Great War. Facing growing pressure to declare war, Wilson successfully asked Congress to do so, claiming that the country had to protect democracy by fighting against the authoritarian regime of the Central Powers. The US officially declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1917, but it took until 1918 for the first troops to arrive in Europe due to the long time it took to mobilize.

The US military was comparatively weak compared to many of the belligerent nations in the war, so in 1917 Congress created the draft, which they used to conscript 4 million men. By the summer of 1918, US troops began arriving on the Western front at a rate of 10,000 a day, putting the numbers in the Allied Powers' favor. America's main problem was experience: there were few veterans among their ranks and many of the commanding officers used obsolete battle strategies that resulted in high casualty counts. Nevertheless, they made important contributions to the war effort, including Cantigny, Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, the Spring Offensive, and the Hundred Days' Offensive. They also boosted Allied morale, which had waned after Russia's capitulation to Germany. The war continued until November 1918, when an armistice was declared and peace negotiations began.

Though the war was not fought in the US, it still changed the country's home front. In order to meet costs for the war, production quotas skyrocketed.

Title: Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Description: The US drops a fission bomb on the city of Hiroshima on August 6, and another on Nagasaki three days later. In total, about 129,000 - 226,000 people died from the attacks, mostly civilians. The reason for the bombing is disputed. Some say that Japan forced their hand, that it was necessary to minimize American casualties, and the civilian death count would have been far more severe had the US gone with their original plan of a firebombing campaign in Tokyo. Others say it was simply a means to demonstrate US power to the Soviet Union, and that such an attack was unnecessary because the Japanese may have been about to surrender due to Soviet declaration of war against them.
